What entity types can use a custom domain in Choreo?,"In Choreo, custom domains can be applied to the following entity types:

1. **API**: This includes components exposed via an endpoint, such as API Proxies, Services, and Webhook components.
2. **Web App**: This refers to the Web Application component.
3. **Developer Portal**: This type does not require an environment to be specified; the customization is applied immediately upon configuration.

When you configure a custom domain for your organization, you can select the appropriate entity type to apply the domain name. Developers can then use these custom domains to request customized URLs for their respective components.

For more detailed information on configuring custom domains for your organization, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#configure-a-custom-domain-for-an-organization)."
What is the purpose of the CNAME record when configuring a custom domain?,"The CNAME record plays a crucial role in configuring a custom domain for your organization in Choreo. When you add a custom domain, the CNAME record allows you to associate your domain name with the Choreo service's target value. This ensures that requests to your custom domain are correctly routed to the appropriate Choreo components.

Here’s how it works in the context of configuring a custom domain:

1. **CNAME Target Value**: When you add a custom domain, Choreo generates a CNAME target value. This value is crucial as it indicates where your domain should point to. You will need to create a DNS record with your DNS provider that links your custom domain to this CNAME target.

2. **Verification**: After creating the CNAME DNS record, you can verify its correctness within the Choreo Console. If the CNAME mapping is accurate, the verification will complete successfully. However, keep in mind it may take some time for the mapping to be globally available.

3. **Usage in Custom URLs**: Once the CNAME is correctly set up and verified, the custom domain can be utilized for your components such as API proxies, services, web applications, and webhooks. This allows you to create a more branded and user-friendly experience for end-users.

In summary, the CNAME record is essential for routing traffic from your custom domain to Choreo services, enhancing branding and accessibility.

For more details on configuring a custom domain in Choreo, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#configure-a-custom-domain-for-an-organization)."
What happens to the Developer Portal when a custom domain is added?,"When a custom domain is added to the Developer Portal in Choreo, several changes occur:

1. **Immediate Availability**: The customization applied via the custom domain becomes available immediately. This means that once the custom domain is configured and verified, users can access the Developer Portal through the new domain without any delay.

2. **Access via Custom Domain**: Users will access the organization’s Developer Portal using the newly added custom domain, enhancing the branding and user experience for API consumers.

3. **Custom URL Configuration**: The custom domain will be available for various entity types in the specified environment, allowing developers to request and configure custom URLs for their components. 

Overall, adding a custom domain enriches the Developer Portal's branding and accessibility, making it easier for API consumers to find and interact with the APIs.

For detailed steps on configuring a custom domain, you can refer to the documentation here: [Configure a Custom Domain for Your Organization](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#configure-a-custom-domain-for-an-organization)."
How long does it take for Developer Portal customizations to be applied after adding a custom domain?,"When you add a custom domain for the Developer Portal in Choreo, the customizations are applied immediately. This means that once you successfully add the custom domain and complete the necessary configurations, you can access your organization’s Developer Portal via the newly added domain right away.

For a detailed guide on how to configure a custom domain for your organization, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#configure-a-custom-domain-for-an-organization)."
What is the difference between importing a TLS certificate and using Let's Encrypt?,"The difference between importing a TLS certificate and using Let's Encrypt for securing services or APIs in Choreo primarily revolves around how the certificates are generated and managed.

### Importing a TLS Certificate
When you import a TLS certificate, you typically have a certificate that has been generated externally (for example, through a Certificate Authority or self-generated). This certificate is then imported into Choreo to establish secure communication channels. The process involves the following:

- **Root Certificate**: A root certificate is used to verify the authenticity of other certificates during the TLS handshake process.
- **Client & Server Certificates**: You need to create and sign client and server certificates using the root certificate. The client certificate identifies the client, while the server certificate helps clients verify the server's trustworthiness.

### Using Let's Encrypt
Let's Encrypt is a Certificate Authority that provides free SSL/TLS certificates. When using Let's Encrypt in Choreo, the process is usually automated:

- **Automatic Certificate Issuance**: Let's Encrypt provides an automated way to obtain and renew certificates without manual intervention.
- **No Manual Management**: You do not have to import certificates manually, as Let's Encrypt takes care of the generation and renewal of certificates automatically.

### Key Differences
- **Management**: Importing a TLS certificate requires manual management, while Let's Encrypt automates this process.
- **Cost**: Let's Encrypt offers free certificates, whereas imported certificates may involve costs depending on the Certificate Authority used.
- **Ease of Use**: Let's Encrypt simplifies the process of obtaining and renewing certificates, making it more user-friendly compared to the manual process of importing certificates.

In summary, if you prefer a hands-on approach and have existing certificates, you might opt for importing. If you are looking for an automated solution with minimal effort, using Let's Encrypt would be more suitable.

For more detailed information on configuring mutual TLS and working with certificates in Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation:
- [Configure Mutual TLS Between Components](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/configure-mutual-tls-between-components/)"
What is the status of a custom URL request before it is approved?,"In Choreo, when a developer requests a custom URL for a component, the status of that request before it is approved is marked as **Pending**. This indicates that the request is awaiting approval from an organization administrator. 

Here’s a brief overview of the process:

1. **Request Submission**: The developer submits a request for a custom URL after ensuring that the component is deployed in the desired environment.
2. **Pending Status**: Once the request is submitted, it will remain in the **Pending** status until an organization administrator reviews and approves or rejects it.

The custom URL request will stay in this status and will not be active until it receives the necessary approval. 

For further details on configuring custom URLs and understanding the approval process, you can refer to the documentation here: [Configure a custom URL for a component](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#configure-a-custom-url-for-a-component)."
What happens to a component's invoke URL after a custom URL request is approved?,"When a custom URL request for a component in Choreo is approved, the following changes occur regarding the component's invoke URL:

1. **Replacement of Invoke URL**: The invoke URL of the component is replaced with the configured custom URL. This means that the original invoke URL that was automatically generated for the component is no longer used; instead, the custom URL becomes the new endpoint for invoking the component.

2. **Visibility of Custom URL**: After approval, the custom URL will be visible under the component's URL settings, indicating that it is now the active URL for accessing the component.

To summarize, once an organization administrator approves the custom URL request, the component's invoke URL is updated to reflect the new custom URL that has been set up.

For more detailed information about configuring custom URLs and the approval process, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#configure-a-custom-url-for-a-component)."

What is basic authentication used for in the context of self-sign-up?,"In the context of self-sign-up for the Developer Portal within Choreo, basic authentication serves as a sign-in method that allows users to securely access their accounts. When configuring self-sign-up, basic authentication is one of the options available to ensure that users can authenticate themselves when they create an account and later log in.

Here’s a brief overview of how to configure basic authentication as part of the self-sign-up process:

1. **Access the Asgardeo Console**: After requesting the configuration of the enterprise Identity Provider (IdP) for your Developer Portal, you will use the Asgardeo Console for further configurations.

2. **Edit the Application**: Within the Asgardeo Console, find the application named **WSO2_LOGIN_FOR_CHOREO_DEV_PORTAL**.

3. **Configure the Sign-in Method**:
   - Go to the **Sign-in Method** tab.
   - Click on **Start with default configuration**.
   - Save the configuration by clicking **Update**.

This setup allows users to sign in using their credentials, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the Developer Portal after they have signed up.

Basic authentication is crucial for maintaining the security of user accounts as it requires users to provide their username and password to access the portal.

For detailed steps on configuring self-sign-up, you can refer to the following documentation: [Configure Developer Portal self-sign-up](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-self-sign-up/#configure-developer-portal-self-sign-up)."

What are the different mapping levels for access control in Choreo?,"In Choreo, access control is managed using a combination of **Roles**, **Groups**, and **Mapping levels**. The different mapping levels for access control are:

1. **Organization Level**: 
   - At this level, you can assign a role to a group, which ensures that all users in that group inherit the permissions granted by that role across all resources in the organization. 
   - For example, if a user has the `edit_project` permission at the organization mapping level, they can edit all projects within the organization.

2. **Project Level**: 
   - This level allows you to assign a role to a group within a specific project. Users in the group will inherit the permissions granted by that role only within the context of that particular project.
   - For instance, if a user has the `edit_project` permission at the project mapping level, they can only edit the specified project.

It's important to note that organization-level permissions take precedence over project-level permissions. Therefore, assigning roles carefully is crucial to prevent unintentional access to resources.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the [Control Access in the Choreo Console documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/control-access-in-the-choreo-console/)."

What is the purpose of mutual TLS in Choreo?,"Mutual TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a security protocol that ensures the privacy, integrity, and authentication of data transmitted between two endpoints. In mutual TLS, both the client and server authenticate each other using digital certificates, which establishes trust and verifies identities. This means that after successful authentication, mutual TLS encrypts the data exchanged between the client and the server, preventing unauthorized access.

### Purpose of Mutual TLS in Choreo:
In Choreo, mutual TLS is used to establish secure connections between components within a project. It enhances security by requiring both parties to present certificates, thus providing mutual authentication. This is more secure than standard TLS, where the server is authenticated, but the client is not.

### Implementation of Mutual TLS:
1. **Generate Certificates**:
   - **Root Certificate**: This is trusted by both the client and the server and is used to verify the authenticity of other certificates during the mutual TLS handshake. You can generate a single root certificate using tools like OpenSSL.
   - **Client Certificate**: Contains the client's identity for authentication, with the common name (CN) in the certificate identifying the client. This certificate must be signed by the root certificate.
   - **Server Certificate**: Used by clients to verify the server's trustworthiness. Like the client certificate, it must also be signed by the root certificate. When generating, specify the server's hostname for the subject alternative name (SAN).

2. **Read Certificates in Your Component**:
   - The method to read mutual TLS certificates can vary based on the component's implementation. Typically, certificates can be read from the file system or through environment variables. When using a **private key**, ensure that it is saved as a secret.

3. **Configure Communication**:
   - Mutual TLS can be configured to secure communication between the Choreo Gateway and your backend by validating each other’s certificates before establishing a connection.

For a visual representation of mutual TLS authentication and further details on the implementation process, you can refer to the following documentation:

- [Configure Mutual TLS Between Components](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/configure-mutual-tls-between-components/)
- [Secure Communication Between the Choreo Gateway and Your Backend with Mutual TLS](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-communication-between-the-choreo-gateway-and-your-backend-with-mutual-tls/)"
What types of certificates are generated when configuring mutual TLS?,"When configuring mutual TLS in Choreo, three types of certificates are generated:

1. **Root Certificate**: This is a trusted certificate used by both the client and the server to verify the authenticity of other certificates during the mutual TLS handshake process. It is responsible for issuing certificates for clients and servers. You can generate a single root certificate for a specific project using tools like OpenSSL.

2. **Client Certificate**: This certificate contains the client's identity for authentication. The common name (CN) in this certificate identifies the client. The client certificate must be signed by the root certificate.

3. **Server Certificate**: This certificate is used by clients to verify the trustworthiness of the server and establish a secure connection. Similar to the client certificate, the server certificate must also be signed by the root certificate. When generating a server certificate, it is important to specify the server's hostname for the subject alternative name (SAN).

For more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [Configuring Mutual TLS Between Components](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/configure-mutual-tls-between-components/#generate-certificates-to-establish-mutual-tls)."
How can I read the generated certificates from a component?,"To access or read the generated certificates from your component in Choreo, you generally have a couple of approaches depending on how the component is structured. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **File System Access**: If your component is implemented to read certificate data from the file system, you can directly access the location where the certificates are stored.

2. **Environment Variables**: Alternatively, your component may read the certificate data from environment variables. This can be particularly useful for configurations that need to be kept secret or dynamic.

For detailed instructions on adding environment variables and file mounts to manage your application configurations and secrets, you can refer to the documentation on [Manage Configurations and Secrets](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets).

Additionally, if you need to generate certificates for mutual TLS, you can create a key pair with a self-signed certificate through the Choreo console or upload your own certificate pair. After generating or uploading, you can view and download your certificates as needed.

For more information on configuring mutual TLS and working with certificates, see the documentation on [Configure Mutual TLS Between Components](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/configure-mutual-tls-between-components/#read-mutual-tls-certificates-from-your-component).

Make sure to handle private keys with care and save them as secrets to ensure security."

What is the purpose of JWKS support in Choreo?,"The purpose of JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) support in Choreo is to facilitate the validation of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) by providing a means to retrieve public keys used for signature verification. This is particularly important for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of claims contained within JWTs.

### How JWKS is Used in Choreo

1. **Public Key Endpoint**: Choreo provides specific endpoints to access the public keys required for backend JWT validation. These endpoints can be used based on the region:
   - US East: `https://gateway.e1-us-east-azure.choreoapis.dev/.wellknown/jwks`
   - EU North: `https://gateway.e1-eu-north-azure.choreoapis.dev/.wellknown/jwks`
   - For private data planes (PDPs), the endpoint follows the template: `https://<PDP_GATEWAY_DOMAIN>/.wellknown/jwks`.

2. **Dynamic Key Management**: Using JWKS allows you to dynamically rotate keys without hard-coding the public key in your application. This means that if the issuing authority (like an identity provider) changes the signing key, the application can fetch the new public key from the JWKS endpoint.

3. **Key Identification**: Each key in the JWKS has a `kid` (key ID) which matches the `kid` in the JWT header. This allows the recipient of the JWT to determine which key to use for signature validation.

4. **Sample JWKS Response**: A typical JWKS response might look like this:
   ```json
   {
     ""keys"": [
       {
         ""kty"": ""RSA"",
         ""e"": ""AQAB"",
         ""use"": ""sig"",
         ""kid"": ""ZjcwNmI2ZDJmNWQ0M2I5YzZiYzJmZmM4YjMwMDFlOTA4MGE3ZWZjZTMzNjU3YWU1MzViYjZkOTkzZjYzOGYyNg"",
         ""alg"": ""RS256"",
         ""n"": ""8vjeHzRhvpfMystncPnLBWy_t5F3eCxbcLbdugWnzfnIgaV6TWnqPBUagJBKpzRZs4A9Qja_ZrSVJjYsbARzCS_qiWp0Cdwkqn6ZCXpmbpfjYnKORq8N8M-zWaSZYbNvWJ5oSO4kH-LKWzODaFebwTJBpsR1vChHH95doxFuUjiZaisVaQgUJ6drRdlDtImp9r9EAX36YROuYFPoEJcvsH4_uuAR6ClJ12RE3M-YN4NTi1waVNvGbz43oNrpPy7SXgpizingxSGMqI6WU2ysRmk_f9ALgiPIpFDpufiCTYaIcRT-YcUyp9nMDlTRskMuD-dQ1sdJOa11P_yMs-glfQ""
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **Claims Validation**: The JWKS is used to validate the authenticity of claims in the JWT, ensuring that the claims are legitimate and have not been tampered with.

In summary, JWKS support in Choreo is crucial for validating JWTs securely and efficiently, allowing for dynamic management of signing keys and enhancing the overall security of API interactions.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation: [JWKS support in Choreo to validate the JWT](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/pass-end-user-attributes-to-upstream-services/#jwks-support-in-choreo-to-validate-the-jwt)."

What are the steps for implementing sign-in functionality in a web application with managed authentication?,"To implement sign-in functionality in a web application with managed authentication using Choreo, you need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set Up Managed Authentication

1. **Implement the Sign-In Functionality**:
   - Add a sign-in button in your web application that redirects users to the `/auth/login` path when clicked. You can use the following code snippet:
     ```javascript
     <button onClick={() => {window.location.href=""/auth/login""}}>Login</button>
     ```
   - This will redirect users to the configured identity provider for authentication, following the OIDC/OAuth2.0 protocols. After successful sign-in, Choreo will set the relevant session cookies and redirect the user to the default post-sign-in path (which is `/` by default).

2. **Obtain User Information Claims**:
   - After a successful sign-in, you can access user information claims via a cookie called `userinfo`, which is established by Choreo's managed authentication. Use the following code to retrieve and clear the cookie:
     ```javascript
     import Cookies from 'js-cookie';

     // Read userinfo cookie value.
     const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo');

     // Decode the value.
     const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo));

     // Clear the cookie.
     Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: <post-login-path> });
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can access user information via the GET endpoint `/auth/userinfo`.

3. **Implement Sign-Out Functionality**:
   - To allow users to sign out, add a sign-out button that redirects to the `/auth/logout` path:
     ```javascript
     <button onClick={async () => {
         window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`;
     }}>Logout</button>
     ```

4. **Enable Managed Authentication**:
   - When deploying your web application component in Choreo, ensure that the **Managed Authentication with Choreo** toggle is enabled. You can set this in the deployment settings.

### Step 2: Configure the Identity Provider

You need to configure your web application to work with either Choreo's built-in identity provider or an external identity provider that supports OIDC/OAuth2.0.

1. **Using Choreo's Built-In Identity Provider**:
   - Navigate to the component settings in the Choreo Console.
   - Under the **Authentication Keys** tab, select **Choreo Built-In Identity Provider** and generate the necessary keys.

2. **Using an External Identity Provider**:
   - Create and configure an OIDC/OAuth2.0 application in your external identity provider.
   - Link the application to your Choreo component by entering the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in the component settings.

### Important Notes
- Choreo's managed authentication is designed for web applications built with **React**, **Angular**, or **Vue.js**.
- It's essential to handle session expiry and implement logic for re-login if a session is found to be expired during API calls.

For detailed documentation, you can refer to the following links:
- [Set up managed authentication for your web application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-1-set-up-managed-authentication-for-your-web-application)

- [Configure the identity provider for the web application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-3-configure-the-identity-provider-for-the-web-application)"
How can I obtain user information claims in a web application using managed authentication?,"To obtain user information claims in a web application using managed authentication with Choreo, you can follow these two approaches after successfully implementing the sign-in functionality.

### 1. Obtain User Information via the `userinfo` Cookie
Upon a successful sign-in, Choreo's managed authentication establishes a `userinfo` cookie that contains encoded user information claims. This cookie is accessible from the post-sign-in path (default is `/`).

Here’s how you can retrieve and clear the `userinfo` cookie:

```javascript
import Cookies from 'js-cookie';

// Read userinfo cookie value.
const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo');

// Decode the value.
const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo));

// Store the value in a preferred browser-based storage if needed.

// Clear the cookie.
Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: <post-login-path> });
```

**Important Notes:**
- The `userinfo` cookie has a short lifespan of only 2 minutes.
- It's essential to securely store the user information since it may help verify the logged-in state of a user.

### 2. Obtain User Information via a GET Endpoint
Choreo provides an additional method to retrieve user information through the GET endpoint `/auth/userinfo`. You can use this endpoint to query details about signed-in users.

Here’s a sample of how to use this endpoint:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo');
if (response.ok) {
    const userInfo = await response.json();
    // Process the user information as needed
} else {
    // Handle the case when the user is not signed in (response status 401)
}
```

**Response Handling:**
- If the user is signed in, the server will return a `200 OK` response with the user information in JSON format.
- If the user is not signed in, the server will return a `401 Unauthorized` response.

### Further Steps
Make sure you have configured managed authentication properly for your web application and that you have set up your identity provider to return the necessary claims.

For detailed guidelines on setting up managed authentication, configuring identity providers, and implementing the above functionalities, you can refer to the following documentation links:
- [Set up managed authentication for your web application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-1-set-up-managed-authentication-for-your-web-application)
- [Obtain user information claims](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-12-obtain-user-information-claims)"
How do I handle session expiry in a web application with managed authentication?,"To manage session expiry in a web application using Choreo's managed authentication feature, you need to configure the session expiry time during the deployment of your web application component. Here are the key steps to effectively handle session expiry:

1. **Enable Managed Authentication**: When deploying your web application, ensure that the managed authentication feature is enabled. This is typically enabled by default for applications built with React, Angular, or Vue.js buildpacks.

2. **Set Session Expiry Time**: During the configuration of your web application component, specify the session expiry time in minutes. This value determines how long a user session remains active before it expires. For a seamless user experience, it is advisable to set this value to match the refresh token expiry time of your identity provider. The default value is set to **10080 minutes (7 days)**, but you can adjust it based on your application's needs.

   Here is the relevant configuration table for session expiry:
   | Field                   | Description                                                                                                         | Default Value       |
   |-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
   | Session Expiry Time     | The time in minutes after which the user session expires.                                                          | 10080 Minutes (7 Days) |

3. **Handling Session Expiry**: If a user’s session exceeds the configured expiry time, they will receive a `401 Unauthorized` status code when trying to access a Choreo API. To handle this programmatically, you can implement logic in your application to automatically redirect users to the login page when a `401 Unauthorized` response is encountered. 

   For example, you can wrap your API calls with logic that checks for this status code and redirects accordingly:
   ```javascript
   export const performGet = async (url) => {
       try {
           // API call
           return await fetch(url);
       } catch (error) {
           if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) {
               // Re-login
               window.location.href = ""/auth/login"";
           } else {
               throw error;
           }
       }
   };
   ```

4. **User Information Management**: Upon successful login, Choreo sets a `userinfo` cookie that contains encoded user information claims. This cookie has a short lifespan (2 minutes) and should be handled securely to verify the logged-in state of the user.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage session expiry in your web application using Choreo's managed authentication feature.

For more details, you can refer to the [Choreo documentation on managing authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-2-enable-managed-authentication-and-configure-the-paths) and [session expiry handling](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-1-set-up-managed-authentication-for-your-web-application)."

Deploy your web application after creating the necessary connection to your API. If your web application is a single-page application (SPA), you can allow Choreo to handle authentication on behalf of your application.

### Step 3: Test the Invocation
If managed authentication is enabled for your web application, Choreo will automatically handle obtaining the necessary permission for API invocation. This process occurs when requesting access tokens, and allows you to invoke the subscribed APIs seamlessly through your web application without needing additional intervention.

### Important Note
If you change the permissions of an existing connection or create a new connection with permissions, you must redeploy your web application to ensure proper API invocation with managed authentication.

By following these steps, you can successfully test API invocation with managed authentication enabled in Choreo.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/test-secure-api-access-with-choreo-built-in-security-token-service/#step-4-test-the-api-invocation)."

What is a multi-repository project in Choreo?,"A multi-repository project in Choreo refers to a project setup where multiple components of a cloud-native application can be organized across different GitHub repositories. Each component can reside in a separate repository, allowing for a more modular approach to development. This is in contrast to the monorepo architecture, where all components are stored within a single repository under different paths.

In Choreo, the flexibility of using multiple repositories allows teams to manage components independently, which can simplify version control and the development workflow. Each component can be connected to its respective Git repository, enabling automation of builds, deployments, and other development tasks directly from Choreo.

When you deploy a project that utilizes multiple repositories, all components are still deployed into a single namespace within the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring that they can communicate and function together as part of the overall application. This structure is beneficial for managing large-scale applications where different teams may be responsible for different components.

For more detailed information about projects and their structure in Choreo, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/project/)."

Overall, PATs enhance the integration between Choreo and your source code repositories, enabling effective development and deployment workflows."
What are some use cases for personal access tokens?,"Personal access tokens in Choreo are primarily used for request authorization and enhancing security when accessing APIs. Here are some use cases for personal access tokens:

1. **Secure API Access**: Personal access tokens can be included in HTTP header requests to securely authorize API consumers. By using tokens, it helps prevent certain types of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on published APIs.

2. **Application Identity**: When an application is registered in the Developer Portal, a consumer key and consumer secret are generated. These credentials represent the application's identity, and the consumer key is used to authenticate API requests. Choreo issues an access token based on this consumer key, allowing the application to securely interact with APIs.

3. **Testing Purposes**: Developers can generate access tokens for testing purposes via the Developer Portal UI. This allows them to test API integrations without exposing sensitive credentials.

4. **OAuth 2.0 Grant Types**: Choreo uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication, and personal access tokens can be obtained using various grant types such as:
   - **Authorization Code Grant**: For secure application-to-application communication.
   - **Client Credentials Grant**: When the application needs to access its own resources without user authentication.
   - **Refresh Token Grant**: To obtain a new access token when the current one expires.

These use cases highlight the importance of personal access tokens in ensuring secure and efficient interactions with APIs in Choreo.

For more details, you can refer to the following documentation:
- [Generate an Access Token](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/generate-an-access-token/)
- [Grant Types](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-application/#grant-types)"
How do I create a personal access token in the Choreo Console?,"To create a personal access token in the Choreo Console, you actually need to go through the Choreo Developer Portal. Here are the steps you should follow:

1. **Access Applications**: In the Choreo Developer Portal header, click on **Applications**.
2. **Select Your Application**: On the **My Applications** page, click on the application for which you want to generate the access token.
3. **Navigate to Credentials**: In the left navigation menu, select the desired environment under **Credentials**. This will open the **Application Keys** pane for that environment.
4. **Generate Token**: Click on **Generate Token** to create a test access token.

This token will enhance the security of your requests by allowing you to include it in the HTTP header requests when accessing APIs.

For further details, you can refer to the documentation here: [Generate an Access Token](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/generate-an-access-token/#generate-an-access-token-via-the-developer-portal-ui-for-testing)."
How do I log in to the Choreo CLI using a personal access token?,"I'm sorry, but I do not have the information regarding logging in to the Choreo CLI using a personal access token. Please refer to the relevant documentation or resources for assistance with this topic."
How do I manage and revoke personal access tokens?,"In Choreo, managing and revoking personal access tokens primarily involves understanding the nature of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and API keys used for authentication.

### Revoking Access Tokens

1. **Understanding JWTs**: JWTs are self-validating tokens that contain all the necessary information for validation. This means that once issued, they do not require server-side verification, making revocation challenging.
   
2. **Best Practices**:
   - **Short Lifespan**: It's recommended to set a short expiry time for JWTs, ideally no more than 900 seconds (15 minutes). This minimizes the risk associated with token theft.
   - **Refresh Regularly**: Regularly refresh tokens to reduce the window of opportunity for unauthorized access if a token is compromised.
   - **Implement Secure Storage**: Use strong encryption and secure storage practices for JWTs.

3. **Revocation Techniques**: While you cannot directly revoke a JWT, you can implement denial lists (blacklists) or allowlists to manage token validity. However, this can complicate the process and may not be foolproof.

For more details, you can refer to the documentation on [Revoking Access Tokens](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-application/#revoke-access-tokens).

### Managing API Keys

If you are using API keys, you can manage them as follows:

1. **API Key Deletion**: You can delete API keys that are no longer needed. This action is irreversible and will immediately revoke access for any applications relying on that API key. It's crucial to perform this action with caution.

2. **API Key Regeneration**: If you need to change an API key, you can regenerate it. The existing key remains valid for a grace period of one hour after regeneration, allowing applications to update their credentials to the new key without interruption.

For managing API keys, you can refer to the following documentation:
- [API Key Deletion](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-api-keys/#api-key-deletion)
- [API Key Regeneration](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-api-keys/#api-key-regeneration)

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage and revoke personal access tokens within the Choreo ecosystem."
What are the best practices for token management?,"Token management is crucial for ensuring API security within the Choreo platform. Here are some best practices to follow:

1. **Use Strong and Random Tokens**: Ensure that any tokens or API keys used are random and not easily guessable. Using UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) is recommended for generating unique identifiers.

2. **Avoid Basic Authentication**: Basic authentication can expose credentials to interception. Instead, opt for more secure methods such as OAuth 2.0.

3. **Do Not Include Tokens in URLs**: Always pass API keys and tokens in headers or as part of the request body, rather than in the URL. This prevents exposure through logging and browser history.

4. **Implement Short-Lived Tokens**: Use short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens. This minimizes the impact of a compromised token since it will expire relatively quickly.

5. **Define Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to control the number of requests a user or application can make to the API. This helps prevent abuse and overload of the API.

6. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for API communication to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. This ensures that all data transmitted is encrypted.

7. **Manage API Keys Wisely**: Regenerate API keys regularly and provide a grace period for applications to update to the new key, minimizing service disruption. Monitor API key usage to detect any unauthorized access.

8. **Set Up Authorization Mechanisms**: Use roles and permissions to control access to specific resources and actions within the API. This ensures that authenticated users can only perform actions they are authorized to do.

For further details on secure API access and token management practices, you may refer to the following documentation:

- [OWASP Top 10](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/api-governance/default-rulesets/owasp_top_10_doc/)
- [Manage API Keys](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-api-keys/)

How does the Choreo Marketplace facilitate service reuse?,"
Choreo Marketplace supports service reuse through its features and mechanisms by providing a platform where users can discover and reuse APIs that are available in the marketplace. Users can easily search for APIs based on their requirements, view detailed API specifications, and understand how to interact with the APIs. Additionally, Choreo Marketplace allows users to explore different types of APIs such as REST, GraphQL, and Async, enabling them to choose the most suitable API for their needs. By promoting API reuse, Choreo Marketplace helps users save time and effort in developing new services by leveraging existing APIs."
How are services added to the Choreo Marketplace?,"To add services to the Choreo Marketplace, you need to deploy your service as a Choreo service within the platform. Here’s how the process works:

1. **Service Identification**: In Choreo, a service is recognized as a Choreo service, which is defined by an endpoint within a service component. Each endpoint in a service component corresponds to a service entry in the Marketplace.

2. **Automatic Addition Upon Deployment**: When you deploy your service to the initial environment, it is automatically added to the Marketplace. During this deployment process, Choreo collects essential details such as:
   - Component name
   - Endpoint name
   - Description
   - Service definitions

3. **Naming Convention**: The service name in the Marketplace follows a specific convention: `component name - endpoint name`.

Overall, the deployment to the Marketplace is seamless and requires no additional steps after your service is successfully deployed.

For further details, you can refer to the documentation on adding a service to the Choreo Marketplace [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/choreo-marketplace/#add-a-service-to-the-choreo-marketplace)."
What information is displayed when exploring a service in the Marketplace?,"
When exploring a service in the Choreo Marketplace, you can find details about the API such as the API name, version, type, title, description, endpoints, and a brief API description. This information helps users understand the purpose and functionality of the API service available in the marketplace. Would you like to know more details about a specific API service available in the Choreo Marketplace?"
How does Choreo handle service versioning in the Marketplace?,"
Choreo handles service versioning in the API Marketplace by providing clear details on the version number of each API service. Users can access the specific version of an API service by referring to the API version number provided. This ensures that users can easily identify and access the desired version of an API service. Additionally, users can manage and update API versions based on their requirements. If you need more information on a specific API service version, feel free to ask for details."
How does Choreo ensure environment-specific configurations are separate from source code?,"Choreo effectively separates environment-specific configurations from the source code during its deployment process through several key strategies:

1. **Environment Isolation**: Each project in Choreo is associated with one or more isolated environments (e.g., development, production). These environments ensure that services deployed in one do not communicate with those in another, providing a clear separation of concerns.

2. **Build Once, Deploy Many**: Choreo utilizes a ""build once, deploy many"" strategy. This means that an application is built only once per commit and can then be promoted to multiple environments. This approach allows for testing in lower environments before promoting to production without changing the code or built container.

3. **Runtime Configuration Injection**: Configurations and secrets are injected at runtime, which means that they are maintained separately from the source code. This allows for different configurations to be used depending on the environment while keeping the codebase consistent across all environments. Choreo handles configurations such as resource credentials and external service credentials, which are stored securely and encrypted.

4. **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Users can define both environment-independent configurations (which apply to all environments) and environment-specific configurations (which apply only to particular environments). Changes to environment-specific configurations can be made on the **Deploy** page of the component, allowing for tailored deployments without altering the source code.

5. **Immutable Deployments**: Once a component is deployed with its configurations, those configurations become immutable. Any subsequent changes require a new deployment, further reinforcing the separation of configurations from the source code.

Overall, this structured approach ensures that while the application remains the same, the configurations can be dynamically altered based on the environment, enhancing security and flexibility.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the [CI/CD documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/) and the section on [Configurations](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#configurations)."
What security scans are performed during the build pipeline?,"During the build pipeline in Choreo, several security scans are conducted to ensure the integrity and safety of your application. The primary security scans include:

1. **Dockerfile Scan**: This scan checks whether a non-root user ID is assigned to the Docker container. If no non-root user is specified, the build will fail as this is a fundamental security measure.

2. **Container Vulnerability Scan (Trivy)**: Choreo uses the Aqua Trivy scanner to detect vulnerabilities in the final Docker image created during the build process. If any critical vulnerabilities (CVEs) are found, the build will fail, preventing potentially insecure images from being deployed.

   - If you encounter critical vulnerabilities that cannot be addressed immediately, you have the option to ignore them by creating a `trivyignore` file in your build context path.

These scans are crucial for identifying potential security weaknesses before the application is deployed, helping to mitigate risks associated with vulnerabilities.

For more details on the build and security scanning process, you can refer to the following documentation:
- [Deploy a Containerized Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/deploy-a-containerized-application/#deploy-the-containerized-component)

What is a component in Choreo and how is it related to a Git repository?,"In Choreo, a **component** is defined as a single unit of work within a cloud-native application. It represents elements like microservices, APIs, or jobs/tasks. Each component is associated with a specific directory path in a Git repository that contains either the program source code or a Dockerfile with the necessary build instructions. 

The significance of components in Choreo lies in the fact that they serve as the unit of deployment. Each component maps to a single pod in a Kubernetes cluster during deployment, allowing you to deploy, manage, and scale each component independently. Choreo supports various component types, including services, API proxies, integrations, and web applications, each with unique features based on their respective characteristics.

### Integration with Git Repository
Choreo allows you to connect your components to a Git repository (such as GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab), which can either be an existing repository or a new one. When you integrate a Git repository, it facilitates automation of tasks and optimizes workflows across multiple systems within the Choreo platform. The repository can contain Ballerina source code or a Docker project. For the latter, the repository must include a Dockerfile and a set of files used to build the image.

By establishing this connection, you can easily build, deploy, and manage your applications directly from the Choreo platform, streamlining the development process.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the relevant documentation:
- [Component Overview](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/component/)
- [Develop Components With Git](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-components-with-git/)"
How does Choreo use Connections to integrate services?,"Choreo utilizes Connections to facilitate the integration of services, enabling developers to create comprehensive and interconnected applications. Here’s a detailed explanation of how Connections work within Choreo:

### Overview of Connections
Connections in Choreo allow services to be integrated either within the Choreo environment or with external resources. When you create a Connection to a service, Choreo provides a **Connection ID** along with various connection parameters. These parameters can be mapped to environment variable names in your Choreo components, allowing you to manage and retrieve values programmatically within your service implementation.

### Creating a Connection
1. **Set Visibility Level**: You can create Connections with different visibility levels - Project or Component. This determines who can access the Connection.
2. **Access the Connections Menu**: Navigate to the **Dependencies** section and then click on **Connections** to manage your Connections.
3. **Create a New Connection**: By clicking **+Create**, you can browse and select the service or database you wish to connect to.
4. **Provide Details**: Enter a name, description, and select the appropriate access mode and authentication scheme for the Connection.
5. **Completion**: Once created, the Connection details will be displayed, including an inline guide on how to use the Connection in your components.

### Using Connections in Your Services
- After creating a Connection, you need to integrate it into your service.
- You can add the Connection configuration in your `component.yaml` file, which defines dependencies on other services. This allows your service to automatically handle the connection when deployed.
- At runtime, Choreo dynamically injects values for the environment variables based on the defined Connection parameters. This approach ensures that your service can easily connect to other services without hardcoding sensitive information.

### Accessing Configuration Values
Within your application, you can access the configuration values using the environment variables. For example, in a NodeJS application, you can retrieve the service URL as follows:
```javascript
const serviceURL = process.env.CHOREO_<CONNECTION_NAME>_SERVICEURL;
```

### Security and Flexibility
Choreo’s design allows for a loosely coupled architecture where connection parameters can be managed separately from the service logic. This not only enhances security by keeping sensitive information out of the code but also allows for easier maintenance and updates.

### Summary
Connections are a fundamental feature in Choreo that promote integration and reuse of services, streamlining the development of interconnected applications. By establishing Connections, developers can leverage existing services efficiently while maintaining security and flexibility in their applications.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [Connections](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/) and [Using a Connection in Your Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/sharing-and-reusing/use-a-connection-in-your-service/)."
What is the difference between Project-level and Component-level Connections?,"In Choreo, there are two types of connections you can create: **Project-level Connections** and **Component-level Connections**. Here’s a detailed explanation of the differences between the two:

### Project-level Connections
- **Scope**: Project Connections are connections that you create to connect to services within a specific project. 
- **Usage**: These connections can be used by any component within that project. This allows for sharing and reusing the same connection across multiple components.
- **Example**: If you want to connect to a third-party service (like Twilio) that multiple components within your project need to access, you would create a Project Connection for that service.

### Component-level Connections
- **Scope**: Component Connections are defined at the individual component level and are **only used by that specific component**.
- **Usage**: These connections are suitable when you need a connection that is unique to a particular component and should not be shared with others.
- **Example**: If a specific component needs to connect to a legacy service, you would create a Component Connection for that service.

### Summary of Key Differences
- **Visibility**: 
  - Project Connections are visible to all components in the project.
  - Component Connections are restricted to the component that created them.
  
- **Reuse**: 
  - Project Connections allow for reuse across multiple components.
  - Component Connections are used exclusively by a single component.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [Project Connections](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/#project-connections) and [Component Connections](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/#component-connections)."
What is the difference between a cloud data plane and a private data plane?,"In the context of Choreo, the key differences between a cloud data plane and a private data plane are as follows:

### Cloud Data Plane:
- **Infrastructure Model**: Utilizes a multi-tenanted infrastructure, meaning multiple organizations can share the same environment while ensuring security and isolation of their applications.
- **Deployment**: The cloud data plane is hosted on public cloud infrastructure owned by WSO2, providing a shared yet secure environment for application runtime.
- **Management**: WSO2 manages the infrastructure, ensuring updates, security patches, and maintenance are handled by them.

### Private Data Plane (PDP):
- **Infrastructure Model**: Provides dedicated infrastructure specifically for a single organization. This allows for greater privacy, control, and compliance with specific organizational requirements.
- **Deployment**: Can be deployed on major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP, or even on-premises infrastructure. This flexibility allows organizations to maintain their data within controlled environments.
- **Management**: Organizations have the option to manage their own infrastructure (self-managed) or choose from various management models where WSO2 can be fully or partially responsible for management and updates.

### Summary of Key Points:
- **Cloud Data Plane**: Multi-tenant, managed by WSO2, hosted on WSO2’s public cloud infrastructure.
- **Private Data Plane**: Single-tenant, dedicated infrastructure for one organization, can be deployed on various cloud providers or on-premises, offers more control and privacy.

Both types of data planes ensure that all traffic related to user applications is contained within Choreo's boundaries, enhancing security and compliance.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [Data Planes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/data-planes/)."
What components are required for a private data plane?,"To set up a private data plane (PDP) in Choreo, several components and requirements must be addressed. Here’s a comprehensive overview of what is necessary:

### Infrastructure Requirements
1. **Kubernetes Clusters**: You need upstream-compatible Kubernetes clusters to host the private data plane.
2. **Container Registry**: A container registry is required to manage your container images.
3. **Key Vault (Secret Store)**: For managing and storing sensitive information securely.
4. **Logging Service or Log Storage**: This is essential for monitoring and observability.

### System Components
During the Helm installation on your Kubernetes infrastructure, the following software components are installed:
- **Cilium CNI and Service Mesh**: For network management and service communication.
- **Choreo API Gateways and Related Components**: To manage API traffic.
- **Choreo PDP Agent**: For facilitating communication and management tasks.
- **Observability and Logging APIs**: Along with observability agents for monitoring.
- **Flux Controller**: For managing updates and deployments.

These components will automatically receive updates, including security patches and bug fixes, through the Flux controller that connects to the Choreo Update Management System.

### Connectivity Requirements
The private data plane must maintain outbound communication with the Choreo control plane for managing various activities. There is no need to open specific ports from the private data plane's perspective, but if your network restricts all outbound traffic, you must allow outbound traffic to the public IP range of the Choreo control plane.

### Summary
1. **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes clusters, a container registry, a key vault, and a logging service.
2. **Components**: Helm installation will set up Cilium CNI, API gateways, PDP agents, observability APIs, and Flux controller.
3. **Connectivity**: Ensure outbound communication to the Choreo control plane.

For a detailed understanding of the private data plane setup and components, please refer to the [Private Data Planes documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/data-planes/#private-data-planes)."
How does a private data plane communicate with the control plane?,"In Choreo, the communication mechanism between a private data plane (PDP) and the control plane is designed to manage various activities effectively. Here are the key points regarding this communication:

1. **Outbound Communication**: All communications from the private data plane to the control plane are outbound. This means that there is no requirement to open specific `IP:Port` configurations from the private data plane's perspective for these interactions.

2. **Network Considerations**: If an organization has network restrictions that block all outbound traffic, it is essential to allow outbound traffic to the public IP range of the Choreo control plane to ensure proper functionality.

3. **Security Protocols**: All communication between the private data plane and the control plane is secured using TLS (Transport Layer Security), ensuring that data transmitted is encrypted and secure.

4. **Connectivity Details**: The table below summarizes the components involved in the communication, their endpoints, directions, and protocols used:

   | Data Plane Component   | Endpoint                               | Direction             | Protocol   |
   |------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------|
   | Choreo PDP agent       | Choreo control plane (CP) (mizzen server) | Outbound              | WSS        |
   | Choreo PDP agent       | Kubernetes API server                  | Outbound (cluster internal) | HTTPS, WS |
   | APIM/local adaptor     | Global adaptor                         | Outbound              | HTTPS      |
   | APIM/local adaptor     | Azure Service Bus (CP)                | Outbound              | AMQP       |
   | APIM/Enforcer          | Event hub (CP)                        | Outbound              | AMQP       |
   | Choreo secret resolver  | Cloud secret store                    | Outbound (VPC internal) | HTTPS      |
   | Container registry      | Container registry (public)           | Inbound               | HTTPS      |
   | Flux source controller  | GitHub                                 | Outbound              | HTTPS      |
   | Flux Helm controller    | Choreo container registry              | Outbound              | HTTPS      |

This structured communication mechanism ensures that the private data plane can efficiently interact with the control plane while adhering to security and connectivity requirements.

For more details, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/data-planes/#private-data-planes)."
What is the purpose of Deployment Tracks in Choreo?,"**Purpose of Deployment Tracks in Choreo**

Deployment Tracks in Choreo serve as structured pathways designed to enhance the deployment process of software components. They address two significant challenges:

1. **Streamlined Deployment**: Deployment Tracks simplify the deployment workflow, functioning similarly to well-organized CI/CD pipelines. They ensure that software components are deployed in a reliable and organized manner, thus reducing the chances of errors that can occur during the deployment process.

2. **Efficient API Versioning**: Especially beneficial for managed APIs, Deployment Tracks provide a straightforward mechanism for creating and managing API versions. This allows seamless interaction between different versions, which is advantageous for both API developers and consumers.

**How Deployment Tracks are Used**

- **CI/CD Integration**: A deployment track can be linked to a specific branch within a GitHub repository. This connection facilitates the handling of deployments to various environments. For instance, when a pull request (PR) is merged, it can trigger an automatic deployment to the development environment.

- **CD-Only Strategy**: If you prefer using your own Continuous Integration (CI) systems, Deployment Tracks can be utilized solely as Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines. In this case, they can be linked to a container registry repository, enabling users to deploy images directly from there.

- **Version Control and Management**: Choreo allows you to create and manage dedicated Deployment Tracks for components, which facilitates independent version control. You can unlink a deployment track from its associated branch or relink it to different branches, aligning with various Git workflows such as GitFlow.

For detailed information on Deployment Tracks, you can refer to the following documentation:
- [The significance of Deployment Tracks](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks/#the-significance-of-deployment-tracks)
- [Streamlined deployments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks/#streamlined-deployments)
- [Manage Deployment Tracks for Choreo Components](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/manage-deployment-tracks-for-choreo-components/)"
How does Choreo's API versioning mechanism work?,"Choreo implements API versioning primarily through a semantic versioning mechanism tailored specifically for service components. Here's how it works:

### Semantic Versioning in Choreo
- **Version Format**: Choreo uses the major and minor version numbers prefixed with `v`, such as `v1.2`.
- **Version Incrementing**:
  - **Major Version**: Incremented when incompatible API changes are made.
  - **Minor Version**: Incremented when new functionality is added in a backward-compatible way.

### Deployment Tracks
When deploying service components, developers specify the major and minor versions as part of the deployment track. These versions serve as the API version attribute for that deployment track. If internal version tracking is needed, developers can use Git tags or GitHub releases.

### Service Versioning in Choreo Marketplace
In the Choreo Marketplace, services are displayed using their major version format. For instance, if there are versions `v1.0`, `v1.1`, `v1.2`, and `v2.0`, the marketplace shows `v1` and `v2`, which correspond to the latest versions `v1.2` and `v2.0`, respectively. When a new minor version is deployed, the service in the marketplace is automatically updated to reflect this change.

### Intelligent Routing
When a service is consumed from the Choreo Marketplace, the traffic is automatically routed to the latest minor version within the same major version. This means that if a component is set to connect to a service version `v1`, it will automatically use the latest version available, thus reducing the need for manual updates.

### API Lifecycle Management
Choreo also incorporates a structured API lifecycle management system, which includes states like:
- **CREATED**: The API is not ready for consumption.
- **PRE-RELEASED**: The API is available for early testing.
- **PUBLISHED**: The API is available for subscription.
- **DEPRECATED**: The older version is still accessible but not open for new subscriptions.
- **RETIRED**: The API is no longer available.

This lifecycle management helps ensure that consumers are aware of the API's status and can adapt accordingly.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation:
- [Efficient API versioning](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks/#efficient-api-versioning)
- [Service versioning in the Choreo Marketplace](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/choreo-marketplace/#service-versioning-in-the-choreo-marketplace)
- [API lifecycle states](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/lifecycle-management/#api-lifecycle-states)"
What is an Endpoint in Choreo and what information does it define?,"In Choreo, an **Endpoint** is a network-exposed function that resides within a service or integration component. It serves as a unique entry point for other services, integrations, or applications to interact with that component. A single service or integration can expose multiple endpoints, allowing different methods of communication, such as REST APIs or GraphQL.

### Information Defined by an Endpoint
Endpoints in Choreo include several key attributes that define how they can be consumed:

1. **Name**: A unique identifier for the endpoint within the service component.
2. **Port**: The network port on which the endpoint is accessible.
3. **Type**: The protocol used by the endpoint (e.g., REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WS, UDP, TCP).
4. **Network Visibility**: This determines who can access the endpoint:
   - **Project**: Accessible only within the same project.
   - **Organization**: Accessible by components within the same organization.
   - **Public**: Accessible by any client, regardless of location or organization.
5. **Schema**: Specifies the structure and format of the data exchanged through the endpoint, often defined using OpenAPI specifications or GraphQL schemas.
6. **Context**: For HTTP and GraphQL endpoints, this is a context path added to the endpoint's URL for routing purposes.

### Additional Information
Each endpoint can have a service contract associated with it, such as OpenAPI or GraphQL SDL, which outlines how the endpoint should be used. If no specific contract is provided, Choreo defaults to using a wildcard route for HTTP verbs.

Endpoints are crucial for API management, allowing lifecycle management and security configurations to be handled on a per-endpoint basis.

For further details on configuring endpoints and their attributes, you can refer to the documentation: [Configure Endpoints](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints-body/)."
What environments are typically offered in Choreo?,"Choreo typically offers developers two default environments within its cloud data plane: **development** and **production**. Each project in Choreo can be associated with one or more of these environments. 

For example, a project may utilize development, staging, and production environments, while another project may only use development and production. This flexibility allows you to promote components across various environments, with the possibility of overriding configuration values with environment-specific values during promotion.

If you are using a private data plane, you can customize and create multiple environments based on your organization's requirements. 

Here’s a summary of environments in Choreo:

- **Default Environments**: Development and Production are provided by default in the cloud data plane.
- **Custom Environments**: If you're in a private data plane organization, you can create additional environments based on your needs.
- **Promotion of Components**: Components can be promoted across environments, allowing for testing in lower environments before moving to production.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation links:
- [Environments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/environments/)
- [Manage Environments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-environments/)"
What is a project in Choreo?,"In Choreo, a **project** is a logical grouping of related components that typically represents a single cloud-native application. The main aspects of a project include:

1. **Composition**: A project can contain one or more components. These components can be organized in a single GitHub repository, allowing for a monorepo architecture where different components reside under different paths.

2. **Deployment**: When components within a project are deployed, they are placed into a single namespace of the Kubernetes cluster. This provides runtime isolation for the components.

3. **Exposure**: Components can be configured to be accessible in different ways:
   - Publicly on the internet
   - Internally within the organization
   - Privately, accessible only within the project

4. **Cell-based Architecture**: A project is represented as a cell in Choreo's cell-based architecture, which helps in managing and scaling applications.

5. **Component Types**: Within a project, components can vary in type, such as microservices, APIs, integrations, web applications, and more. Each component serves a specific function and is designed for different use cases.

Here's an illustrative diagram showing how components are laid out in a project:

![Project](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/choreo-concepts/project.png)

What OAuth 2.0 grant types does Choreo support?,"Choreo supports the following OAuth 2.0 grant types:

1. **Authorization Code Grant**: This flow is used for obtaining an access token securely without exposing user credentials. The user authenticates with the authorization server, receives an authorization code, and then exchanges this code for an access token.

2. **Refresh Token Grant**: This grant type allows applications to obtain a new access token using a refresh token when the current access token expires. Refresh tokens enhance security by ensuring user credentials are not repeatedly sent.

3. **Client Credentials Grant**: This flow is utilized when client applications need to access their own resources without user authentication. It is important to keep client credentials secure to prevent unauthorized access.

4. **Implicit Grant**: This grant type allows applications to obtain an access token directly from the authorization server without the intermediate step of obtaining an authorization code. It's primarily used in browser-based applications but is less secure due to the exposure of the access token in the URL.

5. **Password Grant**: This flow permits applications to obtain an access token by directly providing user credentials (username and password) to the authorization server. It is less secure and is only recommended for trusted applications.

How do I configure endpoints for services and integrations in Choreo?,"To configure endpoints for services and integrations in Choreo, you can follow these guidelines:

### Understanding Endpoints
Endpoints are crucial as they define how your service or integration can be accessed by other services, integrations, or applications. Each service can expose multiple endpoints, such as REST API and GraphQL endpoints, which allow for different interaction methods. 

### Attributes of an Endpoint
When configuring endpoints, you need to consider the following attributes:

| Field          | Description                                                                                       |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name           | A unique identifier for the endpoint within the service component.                               |
| Port           | The network port on which the endpoint is accessible.                                            |
| Type           | The endpoint protocol (supported protocols include REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WS, UDP, and TCP).      |
| Network Visibility | Determines the level of visibility of an endpoint (Project, Organization, Public).            |
| Schema         | Specifies the structure and format of the data exchanged through the endpoint.                    |
| Context        | A context path for HTTP and GraphQL endpoints for routing purposes.                               |

### Configuring Endpoints
The method of defining endpoints may vary based on the buildpack you are using. Here are the options available:

1. **For Ballerina and WSO2 MI Buildpacks**:
   - Choreo automatically detects endpoint details for REST APIs.

2. **For Other Buildpacks (Java, Python, NodeJS, Ruby, PHP, Go, Dockerfile, etc.)**:
   - You can configure endpoints in one of the following ways:
     - **Using the Choreo Console**: If a `component.yaml` file is not present, you can define a basic endpoint configuration during component creation.
     - **Using a component.yaml file**: Manually configure endpoint details by defining them in a `component.yaml` file, placing it inside the `.choreo` directory at the build context path, and committing it to your source repository. This file will take priority over any UI-defined and auto-generated endpoints.

### Dynamic Endpoint Parameters
If you need to define dynamic endpoint parameters (like variable ports), you must use a `component.yaml` file as automatic endpoint generation does not support these parameters.

### Steps to Expose Service Endpoints
If you're deploying a service component, you can define endpoints during deployment:
1. In the left navigation menu, click **Deploy**.
2. In the **Build Area** card, click **Update Image & Deploy**.
3. In the **Endpoint** pane, you can define the endpoints for your service.
4. Click **Create/Update Endpoints**.
5. Under the **Edit endpoints.yaml** section, you can edit the endpoints YAML file or upload associated API specifications (OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas).

For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the following documents:
- [Configure Endpoints](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints/)

What are the different authentication types for container registries in Choreo?,"In Choreo, you can use several authentication types when registering a container registry. Here are the supported authentication options:

1. **Public (anonymous) access**: This option allows you to connect with a container registry that permits unrestricted access. Only the registry host information is needed. For example:
   - Docker Hub (public repositories): `registry.hub.docker.com`
   - Docker Hub (private repositories): `registry.docker.com`

2. **Basic authentication**: For this method, you must provide a username and password to authenticate to the container registry.

3. **Docker config**: You can provide a Docker configuration in JSON format to authenticate to the container registry. Note that this option supports only one container registry under `auths`. The JSON format should look like:
   ```json
   {
     ""auths"": {
       ""index.docker.io/v1/"": {
         ""auth"": ""c3R...zE2""
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Vendor-specific authentication**: This is used for private data planes where your cloud provider manages authentication at the Kubernetes level. Choreo needs to know the registry host for this method. Here are some vendor-specific recommendations:
   - **Azure Container Registry**: Uses service principal-based basic authentication or vendor-specific authentication on Azure private data planes.
   - **Google Artifact Registry**: Uses service account-based basic authentication.
   - **Elastic Container Registry (AWS ECR)**: Does not allow static access passwords; it is recommended to use vendor-specific authentication when attached to an EKS cluster.
   - **Docker Hub (Private)**: Uses basic authentication or Docker config.
   - **GitHub Container Registry**: Uses basic authentication with a Personal Access Token (PAT).

These authentication types allow you to securely connect Choreo with your container registries for deploying and managing container images.

For further details, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/bring-your-own-image/#step-1-register-a-container-registry)."
How do I define endpoints for services and integrations in Choreo?,"In Choreo, endpoints for services and integrations are essential for exposing them to other services, integrations, or applications. Here's how you can define endpoints:

### Definition of Endpoints
Endpoints serve as unique entry points into a service or integration, allowing for various interaction methods (e.g., REST API, GraphQL). Each endpoint can have its own service contract (like OpenAPI or GraphQL SDL) and can expose different protocols such as REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and more.

### Components of an Endpoint
An endpoint in Choreo is defined using a combination of several attributes:
- **Name**: A unique identifier for the endpoint within the service component.
- **Port**: The network port on which the endpoint is accessible.
- **Type**: The protocol used by the endpoint (supported protocols include REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WS, UDP, and TCP).
- **Network Visibility**: Determines who can access the endpoint:
  - **Project**: Accessible only to components within the same project.
  - **Organization**: Accessible to any component within the organization.
  - **Public**: Accessible to any client, regardless of location or organization.
- **Schema**: Specifies the structure and format of the data exchanged through the endpoint.
- **Context (HTTP and GraphQL only)**: A context path added to the endpoint's URL for routing purposes.

### Steps to Define Endpoints
1. **Create Service or Integration**: When you create a service or integration component in Choreo, you can define endpoints during the deployment phase.
2. **Manual Deployment**:
   - Navigate to the **Deploy** section in the Choreo console.
   - Click on **Update Image & Deploy**.
   - In the **Endpoint** pane, you can define or edit endpoints.
   - Use the editor to specify the endpoints in a YAML format or upload related API specification files.

3. **Using Configuration Files**: For integrations, you can define endpoints using a `component.yaml` file located in the project's `.choreo` directory. This allows for flexible endpoint configuration.

4. **Auto-Generation**: If no configuration file is provided, Choreo can automatically generate endpoints based on the APIs defined in the Micro Integrator project.

5. **Default Endpoints**: If there are no defined APIs, a default endpoint is created with public visibility.

### Managing Endpoints
You can manage each endpoint's lifecycle and security settings independently, enabling fine-grained control over how your services and integrations are exposed and consumed.

For more detailed guidance, you can refer to the following documentation:
- [Configure Endpoints](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints)
- [Endpoint Overview](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/endpoint/)
- [Deploying Integrations](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/work-with-the-micro-integrator-runtime-in-choreo/#deploying-integrations-in-choreo)

These resources will provide you with comprehensive instructions on defining and managing endpoints in Choreo."
How do I expose endpoints as managed APIs?,"To expose endpoints as managed APIs in Choreo, you need to follow a series of steps to ensure that your services are secure and accessible either internally or publicly. Here’s a comprehensive guide on how to do this:

### Steps to Expose Endpoints as Managed APIs

1. **Create an API Proxy**:
   - In the Choreo Console, click on **+ Create** under **Component Listing**.
   - Select the **API Proxy** card.
   - You can either upload an OpenAPI specification or provide a sample OpenAPI specification URL. For example, you could use a sample URL and update the details:

     - **Context**: The base path for the API (e.g., `api/v1`).
     - **Version**: The version of the API (e.g., `1.0`).
     - **Target**: The target service URL you want to expose.
     - **Access Mode**: Set to **External** if the API should be publicly accessible or **Organization** for internal use.

2. **Deploy the API Proxy**:
   - In the left navigation menu, click **Deploy**.
   - In the **Build Area** card, click **Configure & Deploy**.
   - Select **External** to make the API publicly accessible, or **Organization** for internal access, then click **Deploy**.
   - Once the deployment is complete, the status will indicate that the API is **Active**.

3. **Publish the API**:
   - In the left navigation menu, click **Manage** and then select **Lifecycle** to view the lifecycle stages of the API.
   - Click **Publish**.
   - Confirm the publication in the dialog that appears.

4. **Promote the API to Production** (optional but recommended):

- [Expose endpoints as managed APIs](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints-body/#expose-endpoints-as-managed-apis)
- [Expose a Service as a Managed API](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/tutorials/expose-a-service-as-a-managed-api/)"
What is the structure of the default component URL?,"The default component URL in Choreo is structured to provide a clear and organized way to access your deployed components. The URL structure follows these patterns:

1. **Default Component URL**: 
   ```
   <domain>/<project-name>/<component-name>
   ```
   - **`<domain>`**: The domain where your Choreo services are hosted.
   - **`<project-name>`**: The name of the project under which the component is created.
   - **`<component-name>`**: The name of the component itself.

2. **Default Endpoint URL**: 
   For components with multiple endpoints, the URL structure includes the endpoint name:
   ```
   <domain>/<project-name>/<component-name>/<endpoint-name>
   ```
   - **`<endpoint-name>`**: This is the specific endpoint associated with the component.

3. **Single Endpoint Scenario**: 
   If your component has only one endpoint, the default URL automatically corresponds to that endpoint.

### Changing the Default Endpoint
If you need to change the default endpoint for a component, it's essential to note the following:
- You cannot change the default endpoint if there are associated published APIs. You must first unpublish the relevant APIs.
- Choreo does not permit changing the default endpoint if multiple deployment tracks exist within its current major version or if the component has been promoted beyond its initial environment.

### Example of Usage
If your project is named `MyProject` and your component is named `MyComponent`, the default URL would look something like:
```
https://example.com/MyProject/MyComponent
```
If you have an endpoint named `v1`, the URL would then look like:
```
https://example.com/MyProject/MyComponent/v1
```

For a more detailed understanding, you can refer to the relevant documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints-body/#understand-the-default-component-url)."

What is the difference between configurations and secrets?,"In Choreo, configurations and secrets serve distinct purposes, particularly regarding their accessibility and usage:

- **Secrets**: These are considered write-only, meaning once you create a secret, you cannot view or retrieve its content through the Choreo Console. However, you can overwrite the existing content whenever needed. Secrets are primarily used for sensitive data such as database passwords, cloud credentials, and service accounts. It is recommended to use secrets for any sensitive information to ensure better security.

- **Configurations**: Unlike secrets, configurations can be read and updated after they are created. This makes configurations more flexible for settings that may need to be adjusted or reviewed over time.

Both configurations and secrets are treated as sensitive content and are stored securely in an encrypted secret vault in the cloud data plane managed by WSO2. 

For more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [Manage Configurations and Secrets](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#the-difference-between-configurations-and-secrets)."

What is the difference between liveness and readiness probes?,"In the context of application deployment and monitoring, **liveness probes** and **readiness probes** serve different purposes to ensure the health of your application.

### Liveness Probes
- **Function**: Liveness probes run periodically to check if the application within the container is still alive. If the liveness probe fails, the container is automatically restarted. This is particularly useful for recovering from situations where the application may have crashed or become unresponsive.
- **Purpose**: The primary goal is to ensure that the application can self-heal by restarting itself when necessary.

### Readiness Probes
- **Function**: Similar to liveness probes, readiness probes also run periodically. However, if a readiness probe fails, the container does not get restarted. Instead, it simply stops receiving network traffic. This means that while the application may still be running, it is not ready to handle requests.
- **Warning**: It's important to note that if you configure readiness probes on a single-running replica, a failure will mean your application stops receiving traffic until the probe passes again. This could lead to downtime if the application doesn’t recover without a restart from a liveness probe.

### Summary
- **Liveness Probes**: Restart the container if the application is unresponsive (self-healing).
- **Readiness Probes**: Prevent the container from receiving traffic until it is ready, but do not restart the container.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation: 
- [Liveness Probes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#liveness-probes)
- [Readiness Probes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#readiness-probes)"
What probe types are available in Choreo?,"In Choreo, there are three main types of probes available for monitoring applications, specifically for health checks. These probes can be configured for both readiness and liveness checks. Here's a breakdown of each type and how they function:

### 1. HTTP `GET` Request Probe
- **Function**: This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on the container. 
- **Success Criteria**: A response status code in the range of 200-399 indicates a successful check.
- **Configuration**: You can configure additional HTTP headers as needed. It is recommended to create a `/healthz` or `/health` endpoint in your service for this purpose.
  
![HTTP GET Probe](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/devops-and-ci-cd/healthchecks/http-get-probe.png)

### 2. TCP Connection Probe
- **Function**: This probe attempts to open a TCP socket to the container on a specified port.
- **Failure Criteria**: If it cannot establish a TCP connection, it is deemed a failure.

### 3. Execute a Command Probe
- **Function**: This probe executes a specified script within the container.
- **Success Criteria**: A non-zero return from the command is considered a failure. For example, if you check for the existence of a file (e.g., `[""cat"", ""/tmp/healthy""]`), the probe is healthy if the file is present.

### Readiness vs. Liveness Probes
- **Liveness Probes**: Run periodically and will restart the container if the probe fails. This helps in scenarios where the application may have crashed or become unresponsive.
  
- **Readiness Probes**: Also run periodically but do not restart the container if they fail. Instead, they stop the container from receiving network traffic, which is crucial for ensuring that only healthy instances handle requests.

What is the purpose of autoscaling component replicas?,"The purpose of autoscaling component replicas in Choreo is to manage the number of instances (or replicas) of your deployed components automatically based on their resource consumption. This feature ensures that your applications maintain high availability and optimal performance by adjusting the number of replicas in response to changing workloads.

### Key Benefits of Autoscaling Component Replicas:

1. **High Availability**: Autoscaling helps ensure that your service remains available, even during traffic spikes. If the demand for your service increases, Choreo can automatically add more replicas to handle the load.

2. **Resource Optimization**: By scaling down replicas during low traffic periods, you can conserve resources and reduce costs. This efficient allocation means you are only using the necessary amount of infrastructure.

3. **Customizable Parameters**: You can set parameters for minimum and maximum replicas, as well as thresholds for CPU and memory utilization. For example:
   - **Min Replicas**: The minimum number of replicas to run (recommended minimum is `2`).
   - **Max Replicas**: The maximum number of replicas that can be scaled up to (restricted to `5` in cloud data planes).
   - **CPU and Memory Thresholds**: These determine when to scale up based on resource consumption.

4. **Scale-to-Zero Capability**: For HTTP applications, Choreo provides a scale-to-zero feature that allows components to scale down to zero when not in use, which can significantly reduce infrastructure costs. When a new request arrives, the system can quickly scale back up to meet demand.

5. **Immediate Response**: The system can rapidly respond to increased traffic by adding replicas as needed, ensuring that performance remains consistent.

By utilizing these autoscaling features, users can ensure their applications are both cost-effective and capable of handling varying levels of demand efficiently.

For more detailed information about configuring and utilizing autoscaling component replicas in Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation:
- [Autoscale Component Replicas](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-component-replicas/)
- [Autoscale Components with Scale-to-Zero](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/)"
How does scale-to-zero work in Choreo?,"The **scale-to-zero** feature in Choreo allows your HTTP applications to automatically scale down to zero when they are idle, which helps reduce infrastructure costs, especially in lower environments. Here's a comprehensive overview of how it works, its purpose, configuration, and limitations:

### Purpose
The primary purpose of the scale-to-zero feature is to optimize resource usage and minimize costs by automatically scaling down services that are not actively receiving HTTP traffic. This is particularly beneficial for applications that experience variable loads, as it allows them to conserve resources during idle periods.

### How It Works
- **Automatic Scaling**: When scale-to-zero is enabled, your service or web application will scale down to zero when it has not received any HTTP requests for approximately 5 minutes. Upon receiving a new request, Choreo will scale the application up from zero to handle the incoming traffic.
- **Dynamic Replicas**: The system can scale up to a maximum number of replicas, which you can configure. If the number of pending requests exceeds a defined threshold, Choreo will automatically increase the number of replicas to manage the load.
- **Proxy Service**: An intermediary proxy service intercepts incoming requests when the application is scaled down to zero. This proxy holds the requests until the application scales up and then forwards them.

### Configuration
- **Default Behavior**: For services and web apps created after February 23, 2024, the scale-to-zero feature is enabled by default.
- **Maximum Replicas**: You can set the maximum number of replicas for the deployment in the Choreo console.
- **Pending Requests Threshold**: The default threshold for pending requests is set to 100, which you can adjust based on your application's needs.

### Limitations and Considerations
- **Supported Components**: The scale-to-zero feature currently supports only web applications and HTTP services. It does not support TCP and HTTPS services.
- **Port Restrictions**: Your HTTP service must run on specific ports (e.g., 5000, 6000, 7000, etc.). If your service operates on a different port, it will not be able to scale to zero.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Scheduled tasks and manually triggered components cannot connect to a service on a project scope when scale-to-zero is enabled. This can lead to errors if attempted.
- **Initial Request Delay**: The first request after a period of inactivity may face delays, as the application needs to scale up from zero. If your application is part of a service chain, this delay may be extended.

### Troubleshooting
You may experience a 503 status code on the first request after the application scales down to zero. To mitigate this, consider fine-tuning the readiness probe settings in the **DevOps** → **Health Checks** view.

For more details on using the scale-to-zero feature, you can refer to the documentation: [Autoscale Components with Scale-to-Zero](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/)."
How do I enable scale-to-zero?,"To enable the scale-to-zero feature for your services in Choreo, follow the steps below. This feature allows your services to scale down to zero when they are idle and automatically scale back up when traffic is received, which can significantly reduce infrastructure costs.

### Steps to Enable Scale-to-Zero

1. **Access Your Component**:
   - In the **Component Listing** pane, select the service component you wish to enable scale-to-zero for.

2. **Ensure Deployment**:
   - Make sure that the component is deployed to an environment and is ready to receive traffic.

3. **Navigate to Scaling Settings**:
   - In the left navigation menu, click on **DevOps** and then select **Scaling**.

4. **Enable Scale-to-Zero**:
   - Depending on your user tier:
     - **Free Users**: Click the **scale-to-zero** card presented in the view.
     - **Paid Users**: Similarly, click the **scale-to-zero** card shown in your view.

### Important Considerations

- **Default Behavior**: For services and web apps created after February 23, 2024, scale-to-zero is enabled by default.
- **Traffic Requirement**: Your service must receive HTTP traffic to scale up from zero.
- **Supported Ports**: Ensure your HTTP service is running on one of the specified ports (5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 7070 to 7079, 8080 to 8089, and 9090 to 9099 or 8290) for scale-to-zero to work effectively.
- **Network Visibility**: If your service has at least one endpoint with the network visibility set to **Project**, it will not scale to zero automatically.

### Additional Notes
- The scale-to-zero service should start within 60 seconds upon receiving a request; otherwise, the request will timeout.
- You can set the maximum number of replicas for your application while enabling this feature.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/#enable-scale-to-zero)."
What are the limitations of scale-to-zero?,"The scale-to-zero feature in Choreo allows HTTP applications to automatically scale down to zero when not in use, which can help reduce infrastructure costs. However, there are several limitations and constraints associated with this feature:

1. **Supported Components**: The scale-to-zero feature currently only supports web applications and HTTP services. It does not support TCP and HTTPS services for scaling to zero.

2. **Port Restrictions**: To enable scale-to-zero, your HTTP service must operate on specific ports. The acceptable ports are:
   - 5000
   - 6000
   - 7000
   - 8000
   - 9000
   - 7070 to 7079
   - 8080 to 8089
   - 9090 to 9099
   - 8290

   If your service runs on any other ports, it will not scale to zero when deploying or promoting.

3. **Scheduled Tasks and Manual Triggers**: When scale-to-zero is enabled, scheduled tasks and manually triggered components cannot connect to a service on a project scope. Attempting to do so will result in an error message:  
   `Host not found, not forwarding request.`  
   To allow a task-type component to invoke a project-level service, you must set it to HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) mode if on a paid plan, or to no scaling if on the Developer plan.

4. **Initial Request Delay**: The first request after a long period of inactivity may experience a delay because the application needs to scale up from zero. If your application operates in a service-chain sequence, this waiting time might be prolonged, potentially leading to timeouts.

5. **Idle Time**: If your application remains idle for approximately 5 minutes, it will automatically scale back down to zero until new requests are received.

These limitations are important to consider when planning to use the scale-to-zero feature in your applications. You can find more detailed information in the [Choreo documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/#limitations)."

Additionally, Choreo currently supports US and EU regions across all of these cloud providers.

If you want to learn more about creating a Choreo-Managed Cache, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/manage-databases-and-caches/choreo-managed-caches/#create-a-choreo-managed-cache)."
What is the formula for estimating the maximum number of connections for a Choreo-Managed Cache?,"To estimate the maximum number of connections for a Choreo-Managed Cache, you can use the following formula:

```
max_number_of_connections = 4 x m
```

Here, `m` represents the memory in megabytes. It's important to note that even on the smallest servers, at least 10,000 connections are available. 

For example, if you have a server with 4GB of memory (which is 4,096 MB), the calculation for simultaneous connections would be:

```
4 x 4096 = 16384 // 16k connections
```

This formula provides an estimate of the maximum connections based on the available memory, and the actual number may vary depending on different service plans and cloud providers.

If you need to check the exact maximum connections allowed, you can use the following command with `redis-cli`:

```
echo ""info"" | redis-cli -u REDIS_URI | grep maxclients
```

What high availability options are available for Choreo-managed MySQL databases?,"Choreo offers various high availability options for managed MySQL databases based on the selected service plan. Here’s a summary of the options available:

| Service Plan | High Availability                                                  | Backup Retention Time |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Hobbyist     | Single-node with limited availability                              | None                  |
| Startup      | Single-node with limited availability                              | 2 days                |
| Business     | Two-node (primary + standby) with higher availability              | 14 days               |
| Premium      | Three-node (primary + standby + standby) with highest availability | 30 days               |

### Key Features:
- **Hobbyist and Startup Plans**: These plans provide only a single node, which means limited availability. In the event of a failure, a new node will start up and restore from the latest available backup, but during this time, the service will be unavailable.
  
- **Business Plan**: This plan includes a two-node setup (one primary and one standby), which enhances availability. It allows for higher resilience to failures and has a backup retention time of 14 days.

- **Premium Plan**: This offers the highest level of availability with three nodes (one primary and two standbys), ensuring the best resilience and a backup retention time of 30 days.

### Recommendations:
For production scenarios, it is generally advised to choose service plans that include multiple nodes. This is because they:
- Provide another physical copy of the data in case of hardware, software, or network failures.
- Reduce the data loss window in disaster scenarios.
- Allow for quicker recovery with controlled failover since the standby nodes are already running.

Additionally, Choreo performs daily automatic backups and continuously records binary logs, ensuring data protection and recovery options.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the [Choreo-managed MySQL Databases documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/manage-databases-and-caches/choreo-managed-mysql-databases/#high-availability-and-automatic-backups)."
What is the formula for calculating the maximum number of connections for a Choreo-managed MySQL database?,"To calculate the maximum number of connections for a MySQL database managed by Choreo, you need to consider the service plan and the amount of RAM allocated. The method to determine the maximum connections varies based on whether your plan has less than or more than 4 GiB of RAM.

### Connection Limits:

1. **For plans under 4 GiB RAM:**
   - The formula is:
     ```
     max_connections = 75 x RAM + extra_connection
     ```
   - Here, `extra_connection` is always `1` for system processes.

2. **For plans with 4 GiB or more RAM:**
   - The formula changes to:
     ```
     max_connections = 100 x RAM + extra_connection
     ```
   - Again, `extra_connection` is `1`.

### Example Calculation:
- If you have a plan with 3 GiB of RAM:
  ```
  max_connections = 75 x 3 + 1 = 226
  ```
- If you have a plan with 5 GiB of RAM:
  ```
  max_connections = 100 x 5 + 1 = 501
  ```

![HTTP GET Probe](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/devops-and-ci-cd/healthchecks/http-get-probe.png)

### TCP Probes
- **Type**: This probe attempts to open a TCP connection to the specified port on the container.
- **Success Criteria**: If a TCP connection cannot be established, the probe is deemed a failure.
- **Use Case**: TCP probes are useful in scenarios where you need to check the availability of the service without relying on HTTP protocols.

### Summary of Differences
- **Protocol**: HTTP probes use HTTP requests, while TCP probes use TCP connections.
- **Success Indicator**: HTTP probes depend on HTTP status codes for success, whereas TCP probes simply check if a connection can be established.
- **Use Case**: HTTP probes are more suitable for web services with specific endpoints, while TCP probes are beneficial for services that require raw TCP connections.

What is the difference between configurations and secrets?,"In Choreo, configurations and secrets are both considered sensitive content, but they have different properties and use cases:

### Secrets
- **Write-only**: Once you create a secret, you cannot see or retrieve its content through the Choreo Console. This makes secrets ideal for sensitive data that should not be exposed, such as database passwords or cloud credentials.
- **Overwriting**: You can overwrite the existing content of a secret at any time, but you still won't be able to view the content after it has been created.

### Configurations
- **Read and Update**: Configurations can be read and updated via the Choreo Console after they are created. This allows you to manage configurations more flexibly as compared to secrets.
- **Use Cases**: Configurations are suitable for settings that might change but do not require the same level of security as secrets.

### Recommendations
For sensitive data like database passwords or service account credentials, it is recommended to use secrets instead of configurations.

Both configurations and secrets can be managed as file mounts or environment variables, and they are stored securely in an encrypted vault.

What is the purpose of the snapshot view in the DORA metrics dashboard?,"The snapshot view in the DORA metrics dashboard within Choreo serves to provide a comprehensive summary of key performance metrics over a selected time period. It includes four main metrics: Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Change, Change Failure Rate, and Mean Time to Recover. Each of these metrics is categorized into performance levels—elite, high, medium, and low—based on the 2020 DORA metric report.

### Key Features of the Snapshot View:
- **Summary Tiles**: The snapshot view displays four tiles at the top of the dashboard, each summarizing one of the DORA metrics.
- **Performance Levels**: Each metric is categorized into four performance levels to help organizations quickly assess their performance against established benchmarks.
- **Visual Representation**: The snapshot includes visual indicators and metrics that reflect the overall performance for the selected time period, allowing for immediate insight into operational efficiency.

This snapshot view is particularly useful for leadership to evaluate the health of their development and deployment processes and identify areas needing improvement. 

For further detail, you can refer to the [DORA metrics documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/monitoring-and-insights/delivery-insights/view-dora-metrics/)."
What does deployment frequency represent in Choreo's DORA metrics?,"Deployment frequency is a key metric in Choreo's DORA metrics that indicates how often an organization successfully releases updates to production. Specifically, in the context of Choreo, it refers to the number of times a component is deployed to the production environment. It's important to note that deployments to development or lower environments are not counted in this metric.

### Key Insights about Deployment Frequency:
- **Measurement**: The metric is dynamically calculated and rounded to the nearest measurement. If more than one deployment occurs daily, it will be measured in ""deployments per day."" For fewer deployments, it may be measured in a higher granularity, such as ""deployments per week.""
- **Organizational Efficiency**: A lower deployment frequency may suggest inefficiencies within the organization, indicating a need to evaluate and improve processes to encourage more frequent releases.
- **Total Deployments**: Choreo also provides information on the total number of deployments within a selected time range, along with the percentage increase or decrease compared to the previous period.

### Visualization:
- **Snapshot View**: Offers a quick overview of the deployment frequency metric for all components within the selected organization.
- **Time Series View**: Displays deployment counts as a bar chart for the selected time period, allowing organizations to identify patterns in deployment activity and evaluate performance trends over time.

For more detailed insights, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/monitoring-and-insights/delivery-insights/view-dora-metrics/#deployment-frequency)."
What is the Lead Time for Change metric?,"In the context of Choreo, the **Lead Time for Change** metric refers to the time it takes for a commit to reach production. Specifically, it measures the duration between when a code commit occurs and when that deployment is promoted to production. This metric is crucial as it provides insights into the efficiency of the processes involved in code review, approval, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).

### Relevance and Calculation:
- **Efficiency Assessment**: A shorter lead time indicates that an organization has efficient processes for reviewing, approving, and deploying changes. Conversely, longer lead times suggest that these processes may need improvement.
- **Production Focus**: The metric specifically focuses on commits that are pushed to production, which is a more relevant indicator of deployment efficiency compared to all commits made during development.
  
Choreo provides a **snapshot view** and a **time series view** for the Lead Time for Change metric:
1. **Snapshot View**: Displays the 95th percentile of lead time for a selected time period, filtering out large outliers to provide a better representation of efficiency.
2. **Time Series View**: Visualizes lead time as a bar chart over a selected period, allowing organizations to identify trends and evaluate the impact of any process changes.

The visualizations help teams assess their performance over time, benchmark against global standards, and monitor the effects of new practices (like peer programming or code reviews) on lead time.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on Lead Time for Change in Choreo: [Lead Time for Change](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/monitoring-and-insights/delivery-insights/view-dora-metrics/#lead-time-for-change)."
What does the Change failure rate metric represent in Choreo?,"The Change Failure Rate metric in Choreo represents the percentage of deployments that result in a failure in the production environment. Specifically, it is calculated as the ratio of failed deployments (those that have at least one incident reported against them) to the total number of deployments made during a selected period. Importantly, any failures that occur during deployment (i.e., before the deployment is live) are not counted as production failures because they do not affect end users.

For the Change Failure Rate metric to be accurate, it is essential that incidents are reported correctly within the organization, as this allows Choreo to identify which deployments are considered failures. The metric is beneficial for assessing the quality of deliverables and can help organizations identify areas for improvement. A higher Change Failure Rate suggests that there may be a need for enhanced quality assurance processes, such as improving code and test coverage.

### Views of the Change Failure Rate Metric
1. **Snapshot View**: This view visualizes the Change Failure Rate as a percentage for the selected time period. It reflects all deployments that occurred within that period along with any incidents reported against those deployments.

What is the difference between an internal and external API?,"In the context of API management within Choreo, the main differences between internal and external APIs relate to their accessibility and security measures.

### Internal APIs
- **Accessibility**: Internal APIs are designed for access within the organization only. They are used to connect different services or components that are part of the internal infrastructure.
- **Security**: Since they are not exposed to the public, internal APIs can implement security measures that are appropriate for restricted access. This typically involves using organizational credentials and internal access controls.

### External APIs
- **Accessibility**: External APIs are publicly accessible APIs that allow users or applications outside the organization to interact with the services. This means they can be consumed by third-party applications or users.
- **Security**: External APIs require more stringent security measures because they are exposed to the internet. This includes implementing industry-standard authorization flows, API throttling, and monitoring to prevent misuse and ensure secure access.

### Managed APIs in Choreo
When exposing endpoints as managed APIs in Choreo, you can choose between making them internal (Organization) or external (Public). This choice impacts how your APIs are managed and the security protocols that are employed. Choreo provides features such as:
- Full lifecycle API management
- API analytics and monitoring
- Secure APIs with industry-standard authorization flows

To expose an endpoint as a managed API, you need to set the appropriate network visibility during the deployment process.

For more details on exposing endpoints as managed APIs in Choreo, you can refer to the [Choreo documentation on exposing endpoints](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints-body/#expose-endpoints-as-managed-apis)."

### Important Notes
- A group in Choreo is a collection of users that inherits the permissions associated with the roles assigned to the group. Therefore, ensure that you assign appropriate roles to the groups to grant the desired permissions to the users within those groups.
- Avoid assigning multiple roles to a single user across different projects or levels to prevent unintended permissions.

For more details, you can refer to the respective documentation:
- [Test Secure API Access with Choreo Built-In Security Token Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/test-secure-api-access-with-choreo-built-in-security-token-service/#step-2-create-roles-and-assign-permissions)
- [Control Access in the Choreo Console](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/control-access-in-the-choreo-console/)"
How do I define users and assign them to groups?,"In Choreo, user management is handled through the creation of **Groups** and **Roles**. Here’s how you can define and manage users, and assign them to specific groups or roles within the platform:

### Managing Users

1. **Understanding Groups and Roles**: 
   - **Group**: A collection of users, where each user inherits permissions based on the roles assigned to that group. For example, if a user is added to the `API Publisher` group, they receive the `API Publisher` role automatically.
   - **Role**: A predefined set of permissions associated with specific capabilities within Choreo (e.g., API Publisher, Admin, Developer).

2. **Creating Groups**:
   - Navigate to the **Settings** section in the Choreo Console.
   - Click on the **Access Control** tab, then the **Groups** tab.
   - Click **+ Create Group** to define a new group and assign it a name and description.

3. **Inviting Users to Groups**: 
   - You can either invite new users or add existing users to the group:
     - **To invite new users**: Use the **Invite Users** option and specify their email addresses while selecting the group you created.
     - **To add existing users**: Search for the user in the **Users** tab, edit their profile, and assign them to the group.

### Assigning Roles to Groups

Once you have created groups, you can assign roles to these groups to define what permissions the users in those groups will have:

1. **Assign Roles**:
   - In the Choreo Console, navigate to the **Settings** and then to the **Access Control** tab.
   - Go to the **Groups** tab, find the group you want to assign roles to, and click the edit icon.
   - Click **+Add Roles**, select the desired role (e.g., Developer), and confirm the addition.

2. **Mapping Level**:
   - Roles can be assigned at two mapping levels:
     - **Organization Level**: Users in the group inherit permissions across all resources in the organization.
     - **Project Level**: Users inherit permissions only within the specific project context.

### Important Considerations

- It is recommended to avoid assigning multiple roles to a single user across different projects or levels to prevent unintentional permission grants.
- Roles must be assigned carefully to ensure that users only have the necessary permissions they require for their tasks.

By managing users through groups and roles, Choreo provides a structured way to control access and permissions across your organization and projects.

For more detailed steps, you can refer to the documentation links:
- [Manage User Permission](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/organization/#manage-user-permission)
- [Control Access in the Choreo Console](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/control-access-in-the-choreo-console/)"
How do I obtain an access token and try out the API?,"To obtain an access token for using APIs in Choreo and to try out an API, you can follow these structured steps:

### Step 1: Ensure Prerequisites
Before you proceed, make sure you have:
1. An application registered in the [Choreo Developer Portal](https://devportal.choreo.dev). If you don’t have one, create a new application.
2. Generated keys for the application (consumer key and consumer secret).
3. Subscribed to the APIs that you want to access.

### Step 2: Obtain an Access Token
You can obtain an access token by following the steps below:

1. **Construct the Authorization URL:**
   ```
   <authorize_URL>?response_type=code&client_id=<clientID>&redirect_uri=<redirect_URL>&scope=<scopes>
   ```
   - Replace `<authorize_URL>` with the **Authorize Endpoint** URL.
   - Replace `<redirect_URL>` with the **Callback URL**.
   - Replace `<scopes>` with the required permissions (e.g., `get_user_list get_user`).
   - Replace `<clientID>` with the **Consumer Key**.

2. **Sign In and Authorize:**
   - Open the constructed URL in a web browser and sign in with the user's credentials (e.g., `Alex`).
   - Click **Allow** to approve the consent.

3. **Exchange Authorization Code for Access Token:**
   - Copy the code from the callback URL and use it to replace `<code>` in the following cURL command:
   ```
   curl <token_url> -d ""grant_type=authorization_code&code=<code>&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>"" -H ""Authorization: Basic <base64(clientId:clientSecret)>""
   ```
   - Replace `<token_url>` with the **Token Endpoint** URL.
   - Replace `<redirect_uri>` with the **Callback URL**.
   - Replace `<base64(clientId:clientSecret)>` with the Base64-encoded value of `clientId:clientSecret`.

4. **Extract the Access Token:**
   - After executing the cURL command, you will receive a response containing the access token. Extract this token for subsequent API calls.

### Step 3: Try Out the API
Using the access token, you can now try out the API:

1. Go to the [API Developer Portal](https://devportal.choreo.dev/) and navigate to the API you want to test.
2. Use the access token in the HTTP header of your API requests. For example:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
   ```
3. Make requests to the API endpoints you have access to based on the permissions assigned (e.g., `GET /users`, `GET /users/{userID}`).

**Note:** Depending on the roles assigned, the user may only access specific resources. For example, if using `Alex`'s credentials, they can only access certain resources, while another user with broader permissions (like `Cameron`) could access more.

For a detailed guide on generating an access token, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/generate-an-access-token/). 

If you need further assistance with testing API invocations, you can check out the relevant section [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/test-secure-api-access-with-choreo-built-in-security-token-service/#step-4-test-the-api-invocation)."

10. **Number of Developer Portal Applications per Organization (Free Tier)**: 10 applications

### API Rate Limiting

Choreo offers two types of rate limiting:

- **API-level Rate Limiting**: This applies a specific request count for a defined time unit across all operations of the API.
- **Operation-level Rate Limiting**: This allows for different rate-limiting values for each operation, providing more control for critical API operations.

Rate limiting is crucial for controlling the rate of requests made to an API. It helps prevent system overload, enhances API performance, and secures the API from potential malicious attacks.

### Rate-limiting Response Headers

When rate limiting is enabled for APIs, the following response headers are available:

| **Header Name**  | **Description** |
|------------------|-----------------|
| `x-ratelimit-limit`     | Denotes the request count allocated for the specified time unit.       |
| `x-ratelimit-reset`     | Provides the time remaining to start the next rate-limiting time unit. |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining` | Denotes the remaining request count for the specified time unit.       |
| `x-ratelimit-enforced`  | Visible after exceeding the allocated request count.                   |

What should the Procfile contain for a Python project using Flask?,"To deploy a Python project using Flask on Choreo, you need to create a `Procfile` that specifies how your application should be executed. The `Procfile` should contain a line that defines the command to start your Flask application.

Here’s an example of what your `Procfile` might look like:

```
web: python app.py
```

In this line:
- The `web` keyword indicates that this is a web process.
- `python app.py` is the command to run your Flask application, where `app.py` is the main file of your Flask project.

Make sure that your application is correctly set up to listen on the appropriate host and port as required by Choreo.

What is an organization in Choreo?,"In Choreo, an organization is defined as a logical grouping of users and user resources. When a first-time user signs into Choreo, they must create an organization and become a member of it. The resources within an organization are typically not accessible to users in different organizations unless an admin from the other organization invites them and adds them as members. Additionally, a user is limited to creating only one organization.

Here is a brief overview of key points regarding organizations in Choreo:

- **Logical Grouping**: Organizations serve as a way to group users and their resources logically.
- **Membership**: Users must be a member of an organization to access its resources.
- **Cross-Organization Access**: Users and resources in one organization cannot access those in another without invitation and membership.
- **Single Organization Limit**: Each user can create only one organization.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on organizations in Choreo [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/organization/)."
What is a project in Choreo?,"In Choreo, a **project** is a logical grouping of related components that typically represents a single cloud-native application. The purpose of a project is to help you organize your work by encapsulating one or more components. These components can be organized in a single GitHub repository, allowing for a monorepo architecture.

Key aspects of a project in Choreo include:

- **Deployment**: When you deploy components that belong to a project, they are all deployed into a single namespace within the Kubernetes cluster. This provides runtime isolation for the components.
- **Access Control**: Components within a project can be exposed in different ways—publicly to the internet, internally within the organization, or privately within the project only.
- **Organizational Structure**: Projects also represent a cell in the cell-based architecture, which organizes the deployment and management of resources.

In summary, the main purpose of a project in Choreo is to streamline the management and deployment of related components, making it easier to build and maintain cloud-native applications.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the [Choreo documentation on projects](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/project/)."
What is a component in Choreo?,"In Choreo, a **component** represents a single unit of work within a cloud-native application. It can be a microservice, an API, or a job/task. Each component is linked to a specific directory path in a Git repository, containing either program source code or a Dockerfile with build instructions, making it the unit of deployment in Choreo.

### Key Characteristics of Components:
- **Deployment Unit**: Each component maps to a single pod in a Kubernetes cluster during deployment, allowing for independent management and scaling.
- **Types of Components**: Choreo supports various types of components such as services, API proxies, integrations, and web applications, each with unique features tailored to different use cases.
- **Connections**: Components can establish connections to other services, allowing them to consume functionality from other components or external services.

### Structure within Projects:
Components are part of a project, which logically groups related components usually representing a single cloud-native application. A project can contain multiple components that may reside in the same Git repository.

### Scale-to-Zero Feature
1. **Default Setting**: For service components and web apps created after February 23, 2024, the scale-to-zero feature is enabled by default. This means your application will automatically scale down to zero when not in use and scale up when a request is received.
2. **Manual Configuration for Older Components**:
   - If you have services created before this date, you can enable scale-to-zero manually:
     1. In the **Choreo Console**, find the component you wish to enable this feature for in the **Component Listing** pane.
     2. Ensure that the component is deployed and ready to receive traffic.
     3. Navigate to **DevOps** → **Scaling**.
     4. Click on the **scale-to-zero** card to enable this feature.

3. **Behavior**: When enabled, your application will:
   - Scale to one replica to handle incoming requests.
   - Scale back to zero after approximately 5 minutes of inactivity.

![Scale to Zero View](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/devops-and-ci-cd/scaling/scale-to-zero-view.png)

### Autoscale Component Replicas
- This feature allows you to automatically adjust the number of replicas based on resource usage:
  - **Minimum Replicas**: Set a minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2).
  - **Maximum Replicas**: Define the maximum number of replicas to scale up to (max of 5 in cloud data planes).
  - **CPU and Memory Thresholds**: Specify thresholds for CPU and memory usage, which will trigger scaling actions based on resource consumption.

### Important Notes
- **Paid Plans**: Autoscaling capabilities are available only in paid plans for private data plane organizations. In the free tier, components run in a single-replica, low-availability mode.
- **Scale to Zero Restrictions**: If your service has endpoints with network visibility set to ""Project"" or runs on unsupported ports, it will not automatically scale to zero.

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues like receiving a 503 status code on the first request after a scale-up, consider fine-tuning the readiness probe settings in **DevOps** → **Health Checks** to suit your application's needs.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the relevant documentation:

My build fails during trivy scan,"To troubleshoot build failures during Trivy scans in Choreo, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Vulnerabilities**: When you build a component, Choreo uses Trivy to scan for security vulnerabilities in the Docker image. If any **CRITICAL** vulnerabilities (CVEs) are detected, the build pipeline will fail. 

2. **Review Build Logs**: Access the build logs to find detailed information about the errors encountered during the Trivy scan. You can view the logs in the **Build Logs** pane, which will show the status of the scan and any specific vulnerabilities found.

3. **Fix Vulnerabilities**: The recommended approach is to address the identified vulnerabilities directly. This may involve updating third-party libraries, changing configurations, or modifying your application code to eliminate the vulnerabilities.

4. **Ignoring Critical CVEs**: If you are unable to fix a critical CVE immediately, you can choose to ignore it by creating a `.trivyignore` file. This file should be added to your Docker build context path. For example:
   ```
   {buildContextPath}/.trivyignore
   ```
   Inside this file, list the CVEs you want to ignore, one per line:
   ```
   CVE-2023-xxxx
   CVE-2023-yyyy
   ```

5. **Redeploy the Component**: After fixing the vulnerabilities or adding the `.trivyignore` file, you can redeploy the component. If vulnerabilities are resolved, the build process should succeed.

By following these steps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve build failures related to Trivy scans in Choreo.

For more detailed guidance, you can refer to the following documentation:
- [Troubleshoot component build errors](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/references/troubleshoot-choreo/#troubleshoot-component-build-errors)
- [Deploy the containerized component](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/deploy-a-containerized-application/#deploy-the-containerized-component)"
I get build errors during vulnerability scan stage,"To troubleshoot and resolve build errors that occur during the vulnerability scan stage in Choreo, particularly when using the Trivy scanner, you can follow these key steps:

1. **Understand the Nature of the Error**:
   - The Trivy scanner detects security vulnerabilities in your Docker images during the build process. If it identifies any **CRITICAL** CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), the build process will fail.

2. **Review Build Logs**:
   - Access the build logs in the Choreo console to get detailed information about the specific vulnerabilities detected. This can help you identify which CVEs are causing the failure.

3. **Addressing Vulnerabilities**:
   - **Fix the Vulnerability**: The best approach is to update or modify your code or dependencies to eliminate the identified vulnerabilities. After addressing the issues, rebuild your component.
   - **Ignore Critical CVEs Temporarily**: If you cannot fix a critical CVE immediately, you can choose to ignore it by adding a `.trivyignore` file to your Docker build context path. In this file, list the CVEs you want the pipeline to ignore, one per line. Example:
     ```
     CVE-2023-xxxx
     CVE-2023-yyyy
     ```
     You can also add comments using `#`.

4. **Redeploy the Component**:
   - Once you have addressed the vulnerabilities or ignored them, redeploy your component to continue the build and deployment process.

5. **Monitor the Deployment Status**:
   - After redeployment, monitor the deployment pane for the Trivy scan status and any potential security failures.

By following these steps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve build errors related to the vulnerability scan stage in Choreo.

I have secret keys as configs for my react web app. How to manage them securely? ,"To securely manage secret keys as configurations in a React web application using Choreo, you can follow these steps:

1. **Understanding Configurations and Secrets**:
   - In Choreo, configurations and secrets are managed as sensitive content. Secrets are write-only and cannot be retrieved after creation, while configurations can be read and updated. For sensitive data like database passwords or API keys, it's recommended to use secrets.

2. **Setting Up Secrets**:
   - When creating a secret, you can use the Choreo Console to define it. Navigate to the component you want to manage, go to the **DevOps** section, and select **Configs & Secrets**. Here, you can create a new secret that will be stored securely in Choreo's encrypted vault.

3. **Using Secrets in Your React Application**:
   - Since Single Page Applications (SPAs) like React run entirely in the browser, you should avoid exposing sensitive secrets directly in the client-side code. Instead, you can make API calls to a backend service that retrieves these secrets server-side and then serves them to your application as needed.

4. **For Non-Sensitive Configurations**:
   - If you need to expose configurations (like API endpoints or feature flags), you can create a `config.js` file in your React app's `public` directory. This file can contain non-sensitive runtime configuration variables, which are then accessible in your React application through the `window.config` object.

5. **Deployment**:
   - When deploying your application, ensure that your secrets are securely mounted as part of the deployment process. This can be done through file mounts or environment variables, depending on how your application is structured.

Here's a concise code snippet to illustrate how to access configurations in your React component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
    const apiUrl = window.config.apiUrl; // Accessing non-sensitive config
    // Use apiUrl in your API calls
}
```

For further details on managing configurations and secrets in Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation links:
- [Manage Configurations and Secrets](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/)
- [Build and Deploy a Single-Page Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-web-applications/build-and-deploy-a-single-page-web-application/#manage-runtime-configurations-for-web-applications) 

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage secret keys and configurations in your React web application while maintaining security."
What steps can I take to protect my web app?,"Choreo provides several features and steps to protect web applications through managed authentication and authorization, which enhance the security of your application. Here’s how you can implement these features:

### 1. **Managed Authentication**
Choreo simplifies the process of adding authentication to your web applications. By leveraging managed authentication, developers can securely integrate authentication without dealing with the complexities of OIDC/OAuth2.0 protocols. Here are the steps involved:

#### Step 1: Set Up Managed Authentication
- **Implement Sign-In Functionality**: Create a sign-in button that redirects users to the `/auth/login` path. This allows Choreo to handle the authentication process.
    ```javascript
    <button onClick={() => {window.location.href=""/auth/login""}}>Login</button>
    ```
- **Obtain User Information Claims**: After a successful sign-in, you can access user information through a `userinfo` cookie or via a GET endpoint (`/auth/userinfo`).
  
- **Implement Sign-Out Functionality**: Create a sign-out button that redirects users to the `/auth/logout` path, clearing session cookies.
    ```javascript
    <button onClick={() => {window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`}}>Logout</button>
    ```

#### Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication
- You can enable managed authentication when deploying your web application component. It is enabled by default for applications built using React, Angular, or Vue.js.
- During deployment, configure paths for post-login, post-logout, and error handling to ensure a seamless experience.

### 2. **Security Features**
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Choreo allows you to create roles, assign permissions, and set up user-group mappings, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources.
- **SAMESITE Cookie Attribute**: Managed authentication uses the 'SAMESITE' cookie attribute to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, enhancing security when using modern browsers.

### 3. **Testing Secure API Access**
Choreo provides an integrated security token service that enables developers to test APIs with permissions in non-critical environments. This includes:
- Assigning scopes to an API.
- Testing API invocation with managed authentication enabled or disabled.

By following these steps and features, you can effectively protect your web applications with security measures provided by Choreo. For more detailed guidance, you may refer to the relevant documentation:
- [Secure Web Applications with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/)
- [Test Secure API Access with Choreo Built-In Security Token Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/test-secure-api-access-with-choreo-built-in-security-token-service/)"
What methods can I use to protect an API in Choreo?,"To protect an API in Choreo, there are multiple methods available focusing on authentication and authorization.

### 1. **Authentication Methods**
Authentication ensures that only authorized users or applications can access the API. Here are some common methods:

- **API Keys**: A simple method of authenticating users or applications by requiring a unique key.
- **Tokens**: More secure than API keys, tokens can be issued after successful user authentication.
- **OAuth 2.0**: A more advanced authentication method that allows third-party services to exchange information on behalf of a user, enhancing security.

Choreo supports integration with external Identity Providers (IdP) such as Asgardeo and Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for managing authentication. By using these IdPs, you can:

- Configure Choreo to authenticate API invocations through the IdP.
- Assign scopes to an API, which are necessary for defining the level of access granted.

### 2. **Authorization Methods**
Authorization controls what authenticated users or applications can do within the API. This is typically managed through:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: This approach allows assigning specific roles to users or groups, determining their permissions for various operations on API resources. For example:
  - A **Human Resource Manager** can perform all operations (list, create, delete users).
  - A **Human Resource Officer** may only list existing users and specific users.

In Choreo, RBAC can be implemented by creating roles, assigning permissions, and managing user-group mappings.

### Summary
By applying these methods, you can effectively secure your API against unauthorized access and ensure that users have the appropriate permissions to interact with your service. For detailed guidance on setting these up in Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation:

- [Secure API Access with Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-asgardeo/)
- [Secure API Access with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-azure-ad/)

- [Secure an API with Role-Based Access Control](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/tutorials/secure-an-api-with-role-based-access-control/)"
How do I invite new people to join my organization?,"To invite new people to join your organization in Choreo, you need to be an organization administrator. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Assign Groups**: As an administrator, you can invite users by assigning them to specific groups. Make sure to choose the appropriate group that corresponds to the roles you want to assign to the new members.

2. **Send Invitation**: Once you have assigned the user to a group, they will receive an invitation via email. 

3. **Acceptance of Invitation**: The invited user must accept the invitation to officially join the organization and gain access to its resources.

It’s important to note that users within a group inherit the permissions associated with the roles assigned to that group. Therefore, when inviting new members, ensure that the correct roles are assigned to allow them the necessary access.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on inviting users: [Inviting Users](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/inviting-members/#inviting-users)."
How do I restrict my API so that only admins can see it?,"To restrict access to an API so that only admin users can access it in Choreo, you can implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Here’s how you can achieve this:

### Steps to Restrict API Access to Admin Users

1. **Create Roles and Assign Permissions**:
   - In the Choreo console, navigate to the API you want to secure.
   - Go to the **Manage** section and then to **Permissions**.
   - Here, you can create a new role (e.g., `admin`) and assign the required permissions to this role. For example, you might want to give the `admin` role permissions such as `get_user_list`, `get_user`, `create_user`, and `delete_user`.

2. **Set API Visibility**:
   - In the **Component Listing** pane, click on your API.
   - Navigate to **Manage > API Info**.
   - Click on the **Developer Portal** tab and under **General Details**, set the **Visibility** to `Restricted`.
   - In the **Visible Roles** section, select the `admin` role you created. This will ensure that only users assigned to the `admin` role can access the API.

3. **Assign Users to Groups with Roles**:
   - You can create groups in your organization, for example, an `Admin` group.
   - Assign users who should have admin access to this group. Ensure that this group has the `admin` role assigned to it.

4. **Publish the API**:
   - After making the necessary changes, go to the **Manage** section and then to **Lifecycle**.
   - Click **Publish** to make the changes effective.

5. **Testing**:
   - You can test the API access by trying to invoke it with a user account that is not part of the `admin` group. This user should receive an access denied message, whereas an admin user should be able to access it successfully.

### Additional Information
- For more detailed steps on implementing RBAC and managing permissions, refer to the following documentation:
  - [Secure an API with Role-Based Access Control](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/tutorials/secure-an-api-with-role-based-access-control/#implement-role-based-access-control-with-choreo-and-asgardeo)

How do I configure my applications to scale automatically?,"In Choreo, applications can be configured for automatic scaling using the ""scale-to-zero"" feature, which allows your service components and web applications to scale down to zero when not in use, thus reducing resource costs. Here's how it works and how to enable it:

### How Scale to Zero Works
- **Default Behavior**: For service components and web apps created after February 23, 2024, the scale-to-zero feature is enabled by default. When no HTTP traffic is received, your application will scale down to zero. Upon receiving a request, it quickly scales up to serve that request, starting with one replica. If the application remains idle for about five minutes, it will scale back down to zero.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Choreo can dynamically scale your application up to a specified maximum number of replicas based on traffic demand. If the number of pending requests exceeds a defined threshold, a new replica will be spawned to handle the load.

### Enabling Scale to Zero
For applications created **before** February 23, 2024, you can enable the scale-to-zero feature by following these steps:

1. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component you want to scale to zero.
2. Ensure that the component is deployed and ready to receive traffic.
3. Navigate to **DevOps** in the left menu and select **Scaling**.
4. Depending on your account type:
   - **Free User**: Click the **scale-to-zero** card.
   - **Paid User**: Click the **scale-to-zero** card.

### Important Notes
- Scale-to-zero is supported only for HTTP services and web applications running on specific ports (e.g., 5000, 6000, 7000, etc.). If your service runs on a different port, it will not automatically scale to zero.
- Services that have at least one endpoint with network visibility set to **Project** will not automatically scale to zero.
- Scheduled tasks and manually triggered components cannot connect to a project-scope service if scale-to-zero is enabled.

For more detailed information about enabling and troubleshooting the scale-to-zero feature, you can refer to the [Choreo documentation on Autoscale Components with Scale-to-Zero](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/#enable-scale-to-zero)."
What options are available for data storage in Choreo?,"In Choreo, there are several data storage options available that can be utilized within the platform:

### 1. **Volume Mounts**
Volume mounts allow you to create writable file system storage locations for your applications. There are three types of volume mounts you can use:

- **Empty Directory (In-Memory)**: This is a fast, temporary in-memory storage location that gets erased when you restart or remove the attached container. It is available on all data planes.
  
- **Empty Directory (Disk)**: This is a temporary storage location on disk that also gets destroyed when the attached container is restarted or removed. This option is only available on private data planes.
  
- **Persistent Volume**: This option provides a permanent storage location that persists even if you restart or remove the attached container. Persistent volumes are only available on private data planes.

All components initially have a writable location in the `/tmp` directory, and you can configure other writable locations as needed.

### 2. **Choreo-Managed Cache**
Choreo-Managed Cache provides a fully-managed in-memory NoSQL database solution compatible with legacy Redis® OSS. It can be used for various purposes, including a cache, database, streaming engine, or message broker. You can create a Choreo-Managed Cache by selecting a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, or Digital Ocean) and following the necessary setup steps in the Choreo Console.

### Utilization
- **Volume mounts** can be used to store application-specific data that needs to be written and read during the application's runtime. This is crucial for applications that require temporary data storage or persistent data management.
  
- **Choreo-Managed Cache** can be utilized for applications that require fast access to data, such as caching results from database queries, or for applications that need a messaging system.

### Steps to Create Persistent Storage:
1. Navigate to the **DevOps** section of your component in the Choreo Console.
2. Click on **Storage** and then **+ Create**.
3. Follow the prompts to specify your volume type and configurations.

For more detailed instructions on creating both volume mounts and Choreo-Managed Cache, you can refer to the following links:

"I'm getting """"procfile not found"""" error for my python service. How do I resolve this?","To fix the 'Procfile not found' error for a Python service in Choreo, you need to ensure that a `Procfile` is present in the root directory of your project. The `Procfile` is a configuration file that declares the commands to run your application's containers. For Python projects, it is mandatory to include a `Procfile` with a `web` process type.

Here’s how to create and configure the `Procfile`:

1. **Create a `Procfile`**: In the root directory of your project, create a file named `Procfile` (with no file extension).

2. **Add the web process command**: Inside the `Procfile`, add the command to start your application. Here are some examples of what you might include:

   ```
   web: python main.py
   ```

   or

   ```
   web: gunicorn --bind :8080 --workers 1 --threads 8 --timeout 0 main:app
   ```

   or

   ```
   web: flask run --host=0.0.0.0
   ```

Make sure to replace the command with the appropriate one for your application. After adding the `Procfile`, redeploy your service, and the 'Procfile not found' error should be resolved.

For more detailed guidance, you can refer to the official documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/deploy-an-application-with-buildpacks/#develop-a-component)."
I'm getting .choreo/endpoints.yaml not found error. How do I resolve this?,"To resolve the `.choreo/endpoints.yaml not found` error in Choreo, you need to ensure that the `endpoints.yaml` file is properly placed and configured in your project's directory structure.

### Steps to Resolve the Error:

1. **File Location**: Ensure that the `endpoints.yaml` file is located in the `.choreo` directory at the root of your project. The expected path is:
   ```bash
   <build-context-path>/.choreo/endpoints.yaml
   ```

2. **File Content**: Verify that your `endpoints.yaml` file contains the necessary configurations. A minimal valid configuration should look something like this:
   ```yaml
   version: 0.1
   endpoints:
   - name: Your Endpoint Name
     port: 9090
     type: REST
     networkVisibility: Project
     context: /your-context
     schemaFilePath: your_schema_file.yaml
   ```
   Ensure that you have provided the required fields such as `version`, `name`, `port`, `type`, `networkVisibility`, and `context`. The `schemaFilePath` is optional but should be included if your endpoint requires it.

3. **Using `component.yaml`**: If you don't have an `endpoints.yaml` file, you can also define the endpoint settings in a `component.yaml` file, which takes precedence over `endpoints.yaml`. Make sure to place this file in the same `.choreo` directory.

### Additional Notes:
- The `endpoints.yaml` file is critical for defining endpoint configurations for your Choreo service components. If it's not found, Choreo won't be able to generate the necessary endpoint configurations for your service.
- If you are using certain buildpacks (like Ballerina or WSO2 MI), endpoints may be auto-generated, but for other buildpacks, you need to define them explicitly.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation links:
- [Overview of the `endpoints.yaml` file](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/manage-component-source-configurations/#overview-of-the-endpointsyaml-file)
