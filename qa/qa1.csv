What entity types can use a custom domain in Choreo?,"In Choreo, the types of entities that can use a custom domain include:\n\n1. **API**: This entity type represents Choreo components that are exposed via an endpoint, which includes API Proxy, Service, and Webhook components.\n2. **Web App**: This entity type represents the Web Application component.\n3. **Developer Portal**: When a custom domain is added for the Developer Portal type, it applies immediately, and you can access the organization’s Developer Portal via the added domain.\n\nOnce an organization administrator adds a custom domain, component developers can submit requests to use these custom domains for their respective components, which then require approval from the organization administrator.\n\nFor more detailed information about configuring custom domains and their usage in Choreo, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#configure-a-custom-domain-for-an-organization)."
What is the purpose of the CNAME record when configuring a custom domain?,"A CNAME (Canonical Name) record is used in DNS (Domain Name System) to create an alias for a domain name. When configuring a custom domain in Choreo, the CNAME record serves to map your custom domain to the target domain provided by Choreo. This is essential for redirecting requests from your custom domain to the appropriate Choreo services, ensuring that users can access your components seamlessly under your branded domain.\n\nHere’s a brief overview of how it fits into the process of configuring a custom domain in Choreo:\n\n1. **Adding a Custom Domain**: When you add a custom domain for your organization in the Choreo Console, you will receive a generated CNAME target value.\n2. **Creating the DNS Record**: You need to create a DNS record with your domain provider that associates your custom domain with the provided CNAME target value. This tells DNS servers that requests for your custom domain should be directed to the Choreo infrastructure.\n3. **Verification**: After setting up the CNAME record, you can verify the mapping in the Choreo Console. If the mapping is correct, you'll be able to proceed with configuring TLS certificates and finalizing the setup.\n\nThis process allows components such as APIs and web applications to be accessible through a custom URL that reflects your brand, enhancing discoverability and credibility.\n\nFor more detailed instructions on configuring a custom domain in Choreo, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#configure-a-custom-domain-for-an-organization)."
What happens to the Developer Portal when a custom domain is added?,"When a custom domain is added to the Developer Portal in Choreo, several significant changes and behaviors occur:\n\n1. **Immediate Customization**: The customization associated with the custom domain is applied immediately. This means that once the domain is successfully verified and configured, the Developer Portal can be accessed via the new custom domain right away.\n\n2. **Access through Custom Domain**: Users can access the organization’s Developer Portal directly through the added custom domain, enhancing the branding and user experience. This allows for a seamless transition for users who are accustomed to the organization's original domain.\n\n3. **Request for Component Custom URLs**: Component developers can submit requests to use the newly added custom domain for their respective components. These requests need approval from the organization administrator. Once approved, the custom domain and relevant URL customization become available for the component.\n\n4. **Management of Custom Domains**: The custom domain will be listed under the **Active Domains** tab in the **URL Settings** section of the organization settings. Admins can manage the custom domains, including viewing which entities utilize specific domains.\n\n5. **Theming and Branding**: Administrators can further customize the Developer Portal's appearance (such as themes, colors, and logos) to align with the organization’s branding, providing a cohesive look and feel that reflects the brand identity.\n\nThese changes enhance the overall user experience for API consumers and provide administrators with greater control over branding and access.\n\nFor more detailed information about configuring a custom domain, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#configure-a-custom-domain-for-an-organization)."
How long does it take for Developer Portal customizations to be applied after adding a custom domain?,"After adding a custom domain for the Developer Portal in Choreo, the customization is applied immediately. This means you can access your organization’s Developer Portal via the added domain right after the successful configuration.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the customization takes effect immediately, the configuration of the CNAME mapping may take some time to propagate globally. Therefore, while you should be able to use the custom domain right away, there might be a delay before it is fully available to all users.\n\nFor more detailed steps on how to configure a custom domain, you can refer to the official documentation here: [Configure a Custom Domain for Your Organization](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#configure-a-custom-domain-for-an-organization)."
What is the difference between importing a TLS certificate and using Let's Encrypt?,"In Choreo, there are two main methods for handling TLS certificates when configuring a custom domain: importing a TLS certificate and using Let's Encrypt. Here's a breakdown of the differences between the two:\n\n### Importing a TLS Certificate\n- **Manual Management**: When you choose to import a TLS certificate, you are responsible for managing the certificate lifecycle, including renewal and updates.\n- **Certificate Requirements**: The imported certificate must meet specific guidelines:\n  - It should be issued by a recognized certificate authority (CA) and include the public key along with other details such as domain name, owner information, expiration date, and the CA's digital signature.\n  - The certificate must be in X.509 format and in PEM format.\n  - It can be a direct certificate for a specific domain or a wildcard certificate covering subdomains.\n- **Additional Files**: When importing, you may also need to provide:\n  - A TLS key file (must be in PEM format and RSA encrypted).\n  - A certificate chain file, if necessary, to ensure clients can verify the server's SSL/TLS certificate.\n  \n### Using Let's Encrypt\n- **Automated Management**: By opting for Let's Encrypt, Choreo will automatically generate and manage the TLS certificates for your custom domain. This includes handling renewals, which can alleviate the administrative burden associated with certificate management.\n- **Simplicity**: This option is generally simpler for users who may not want to deal with the complexities of certificate generation and management, as it requires minimal setup on the user's part.\n\nIn summary, if you import a TLS certificate, you take on the responsibility for its management and compliance with specific standards. In contrast, using Let's Encrypt allows Choreo to automate the process, providing ease of use and less administrative overhead.\n\nFor more details on configuring a custom domain and the TLS certificate options, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#configure-a-custom-domain-for-an-organization)."
What is the status of a custom URL request before it is approved?,"In Choreo, when a developer requests a custom URL for a component, the status of that request is marked as **Pending** until it is approved by an organization administrator. Here’s how the process works:\n\n1. **Requesting a Custom URL**:\n   - A developer adds a custom URL request through the Choreo console after ensuring that the component is deployed to the specific environment.\n   - They navigate to the component’s settings and submit a request for a custom URL. This request includes selecting an available domain and defining the path for the service.\n\n2. **Pending Status**:\n   - Once the request is made, it will be listed under the **Pending** status in the organization-level settings. At this stage, it is awaiting approval from an administrator.\n\n3. **Approval Process**:\n   - The organization administrator reviews all pending custom URL requests via the organization settings in the Choreo console. They can approve or reject these requests based on the organization's policies.\n   - Upon approval, the custom URL mapping is activated, and the component's invoke URL is updated to the configured custom URL.\n\nHere’s a visual reference for understanding the pending status:\n![Pending custom URL request](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/administer/configure-domain/pending-custom-url-request.png)\n\nFor more detailed information on configuring and managing custom URLs, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#configure-a-custom-url-for-a-component)."
What happens to a component's invoke URL after a custom URL request is approved?,"After a custom URL request for a component is approved in Choreo, the invoke URL of that component is updated to reflect the newly configured custom URL. This means that the default invoke URL, which typically follows the structure `<domain>/<project-name>/<component-name>`, will be replaced by the custom URL specified in the request.\n\n### Process Overview:\n1. **Request Submission**: A developer submits a request for a custom URL for their component. Until the request is approved, its status remains ""Pending.""\n2. **Approval**: An organization administrator reviews and approves the request from the organization-level settings page.\n3. **Invoke URL Update**: Once the request is approved, the component's invoke URL is replaced with the approved custom URL. This allows users to access the component through the custom domain rather than the default structure.\n\nThis process allows for a more branded or user-friendly URL for accessing the component, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\nFor more detailed information about configuring a custom URL for a component, you can refer to the documentation here: [Configure a Custom Domain for Your Organization](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#configure-a-custom-url-for-a-component)."

What are the different mapping levels for access control in Choreo?,"In Choreo, access control is managed using a combination of **Roles**, **Groups**, and **Mapping levels**. The mapping level defines how roles are assigned to groups within the context of the Choreo Console. There are two distinct mapping levels for access control:\n\n1. **Organization Level**:\n   - At this level, a role can be assigned to a group within the entire organization. This means that all users in the assigned group inherit the permissions granted by that role across all organizational resources.\n   - For example, if a user has the `edit_project` permission at the organization mapping level, that user can edit all projects within the organization.\n\n2. **Project Level**:\n   - This level allows for role assignments limited to a specific project. Users in a group will inherit the permissions granted by that role only within the specified project.\n   - For instance, if a user has the `edit_project` permission at the project mapping level, that user can only edit the specified project.\n\nIt's important to note that organization-level permissions take precedence over project-level permissions. Therefore, careful management of role assignments is essential to prevent unintended access.\n\nFor a more comprehensive overview of access control in Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation: [Control Access in the Choreo Console](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/control-access-in-the-choreo-console/)."
What is the purpose of creating a group in the context of access control?,I'm here to assist with questions related to Choreo. Could you please clarify if your question is about access control within Choreo's platform or if it pertains to another context?
Can I assign multiple roles to a group?,"Yes, in Choreo, multiple roles can be assigned to a group. A group in Choreo is defined as a collection of users, and each group can have one or more roles assigned to it. This allows users within the group to inherit the permissions associated with all the roles assigned to that group.\n\nFor instance, if you create a group and assign both the ""Developer"" and ""API Publisher"" roles to it, all users in that group will have the combined permissions of both roles.\n\nTo assign roles to a group, you would typically navigate to the **Role Management** section under **Application Security** in the Choreo Console. From there, you can map multiple groups to the desired roles.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the relevant documentation here: [Control Access in the Choreo Console](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/control-access-in-the-choreo-console/)."

What is the purpose of mutual TLS in Choreo?,"Mutual TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a security protocol that ensures privacy, integrity, and authentication of data transmitted between two endpoints. In mutual TLS, both the client and server authenticate each other using digital certificates, establishing a trust relationship and verifying identities. This process not only ensures the confidentiality of the data exchanged but also prevents unauthorized access through encryption.\n\n### Purpose of Mutual TLS in Choreo\nIn Choreo, mutual TLS can be used to establish secure connections between components within a project. By implementing mutual TLS, you enhance the security of your services by requiring both parties in the communication to present valid certificates, thus facilitating mutual verification of identities.\n\n### Implementation Steps for Mutual TLS\n1. **Generate Certificates**:\n   - **Root Certificate**: This is a trusted certificate used to verify the authenticity of other certificates during the mutual TLS handshake. You can generate a root certificate using tools like OpenSSL.\n   - **Client Certificate**: This certificate contains the client’s identity, identified by the common name (CN). It must be signed by the root certificate.\n   - **Server Certificate**: This is used by clients to verify the server's identity. It must also be signed by the root certificate, and you should specify the server's hostname in the subject alternative name (SAN).\n\n2. **Read Mutual TLS Certificates**:\n   - Components can read their mutual TLS certificates either from the file system or via environment variables. Ensure that any private key is saved securely as a secret.\n\n3. **Configure Components**:\n   - Ensure that all components that need to communicate securely are configured to use mutual TLS, including specifying the appropriate certificates for both the client and server.\n\n4. **Secure Communication Setup**:\n   - After configuring mutual TLS, you can establish secure communication between the Choreo Gateway and your backend services.\n\nFor a visual representation of the mutual TLS authentication process, refer to the following diagram:\n\n![Mutual TLS authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/authentication-and-authorization/mutual-ssl-authentication.png)\n\nFor additional details on the implementation process, you can refer to the following documentation links:\n- [Configure Mutual TLS Between Components](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/configure-mutual-tls-between-components/)\n- [Secure Communication Between the Choreo Gateway and Your Backend with Mutual TLS](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-communication-between-the-choreo-gateway-and-your-backend-with-mutual-tls/)"
What types of certificates are generated when configuring mutual TLS?,"When configuring mutual TLS in Choreo, three types of certificates are generated:\n\n1. **Root Certificate**: This is a trusted certificate that both the client and server use to verify the authenticity of other certificates presented during the mutual TLS handshake process. It is also used to issue certificates for clients and servers. You can generate a single root certificate for a specific project using tools like OpenSSL.\n\n2. **Client Certificate**: This certificate contains the client’s identity for authentication. The common name (CN) in the certificate identifies the client. The client certificate must be signed by the root certificate to ensure its validity.\n\n3. **Server Certificate**: This certificate is used by clients to verify the trustworthiness of the server and to establish a secure connection. Like the client certificate, the server certificate must also be signed by the root certificate. When generating the server certificate, you must specify the server's hostname for the subject alternative name (SAN).\n\nFor further details on configuring mutual TLS, you can refer to the [Choreo documentation on mutual TLS](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/configure-mutual-tls-between-components/#generate-certificates-to-establish-mutual-tls)."
How can I read the generated certificates from a component?,"To access and read the generated certificates from a component in Choreo, you can follow these general approaches depending on how your component is implemented:\n\n1. **Reading from the File System**: \n   - Your component may be configured to read the certificate data directly from the file system. Ensure that the certificates are stored in the appropriate directories within your component's runtime environment.\n\n2. **Using Environment Variables**: \n   - Alternatively, your component might be set up to access the certificates through environment variables. You can specify these environment variables in your component's configuration.\n\nFor more detailed instructions on managing configurations and secrets, including how to add environment variables and file mounts to your application, refer to the [Manage Configurations and Secrets documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets).\n\nIf you need to generate certificates and establish mutual TLS, you can do so through the Choreo console, which allows you to create a key pair and subsequently view and download the generated certificates. \n\nFor further steps on generating certificates and utilizing them in your components, see the relevant sections in the documentation:\n- [Generate certificates to establish mutual TLS](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/configure-mutual-tls-between-components/#generate-certificates-to-establish-mutual-tls)\n- [Read mutual TLS certificates from your component](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/configure-mutual-tls-between-components/#read-mutual-tls-certificates-from-your-component).\n\nIf you have specific questions regarding the implementation of mutual TLS or need additional assistance, please let me know!"

What is the purpose of JWKS support in Choreo?,"The purpose of JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) support in Choreo is to facilitate the validation of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) by providing a set of public keys that can be used to verify the signatures of those tokens. This is essential for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the claims contained within the JWTs during communication between services.\n\n### Functionality of JWKS in Choreo:\n\n1. **Public Key Endpoint**: Choreo offers specific endpoint URLs for retrieving the JWKS, which includes the public keys necessary for validating JWTs. For example, endpoints for the US East and EU regions are:\n   - [US East](https://gateway.e1-us-east-azure.choreoapis.dev/.wellknown/jwks)\n   - [EU North](https://gateway.e1-eu-north-azure.choreoapis.dev/.wellknown/jwks)\n\n   For private data planes (PDPs), the endpoint follows the template:\n   ```\n   https://<PDP_GATEWAY_DOMAIN>/.wellknown/jwks\n   ```\n   Here, `<PDP_GATEWAY_DOMAIN>` needs to be replaced with the appropriate domain configured for the PDP APIs.\n\n2. **Dynamic Key Management**: JWKS allows for the dynamic rotation of keys, meaning that the issuer (e.g., an identity provider) can change the keys without requiring the recipient to hard-code these keys in their application. The recipient can simply fetch the latest public keys from the JWKS endpoint.\n\n3. **Key Identification**: Each key in the JWKS has a `kid` (Key ID) that corresponds to a property within the JWT. This allows the application to select the correct public key for validating the JWT based on the `kid` value.\n\n4. **JWKS Response Structure**: The JWKS response provides a JSON object containing an array of keys. Each key includes several properties:\n   - `kty`: The key type (e.g., RSA).\n   - `e`: The exponent value of the public key.\n   - `use`: The purpose of the key (e.g., for signing).\n   - `kid`: The key identifier for matching.\n   - `alg`: The algorithm used with the key.\n   - `n`: The modulus value of the public key.\n\n   Here is a sample structure of a JWKS response:\n   ```json\n   {\n     ""keys"": [\n       {\n         ""kty"": ""RSA"",\n         ""e"": ""AQAB"",\n         ""use"": ""sig"",\n         ""kid"": ""unique_key_identifier"",\n         ""alg"": ""RS256"",\n         ""n"": ""modulus_value""\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, JWKS support in Choreo enhances security by providing a reliable way to verify JWTs through public key retrieval and dynamic key management. This ensures that services can authenticate requests securely and efficiently.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation: [JWKS support in Choreo to validate the JWT](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/pass-end-user-attributes-to-upstream-services/#jwks-support-in-choreo-to-validate-the-jwt)."

What are the steps for implementing sign-in functionality in a web application with managed authentication?,"To implement sign-in functionality in a web application using Choreo's managed authentication services, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Managed Authentication for Your Web Application\n\n#### 1.1 Implement the Sign-In Functionality\nYou need to create a sign-in button in your web application that redirects users to the Choreo authentication URL when clicked. Here’s a sample code snippet for this button:\n\n```javascript\n<button onClick={() => { window.location.href = ""/auth/login"" }}>Login</button>\n```\n\nWhen the button is clicked, users are redirected to the configured identity provider where Choreo handles the authentication process. Upon successful sign-in, relevant session cookies are set, and users are redirected to a specified post-sign-in path (default is `/`).\n\n#### Optional: Pass Additional Query Parameters\nIf you need to pass additional parameters to the identity provider, you can modify the login URL like this:\n\n```javascript\n<button onClick={() => { window.location.href = ""/auth/login?fidp=myfederatedidp"" }}>Login</button>\n```\n\n### Step 2: Configure the Identity Provider\nYou need to configure the identity provider that your web application will use. This can either be the built-in identity provider provided by Choreo or an external one that supports OIDC/OAuth2.0.\n\n1. Go to your component in the Choreo Console.\n2. Click on **Settings**.\n3. Under the **Authentication Keys** tab, select your identity provider and generate the necessary authentication keys.\n\n### Step 3: Enable Managed Authentication\nWhen deploying your web application, ensure that managed authentication is enabled:\n\n1.

Make sure the **Managed Authentication with Choreo** toggle is enabled and fill in the necessary fields, including post-login paths.\n\n### Step 4: Obtain User Information Claims\nAfter sign-in, you can access user information claims either via a cookie or by invoking a GET resource. Here’s how to retrieve user information from the `userinfo` cookie:\n\n```javascript\nimport Cookies from 'js-cookie';\n\n// Read userinfo cookie value.\nconst encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo')\n\n// Decode the value.\nconst userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo))\n\n// Clear the cookie after use.\nCookies.remove('userinfo', { path: <post-login-path> })\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can retrieve user information by calling the `/auth/userinfo` endpoint:\n\n```javascript\nconst response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo');\n```\n\n### Step 5: Implement Sign-Out Functionality\nTo allow users to sign out, create a sign-out button that redirects them to the logout path:\n\n```javascript\n<button onClick={async () => {\n    window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`;\n}}>Logout</button>\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- Make sure to handle session expiry and implement a custom error page if needed.\n- For more detailed steps and examples, refer to the Choreo documentation on [setting up managed authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-1-set-up-managed-authentication-for-your-web-application).\n\nThese steps will help you successfully implement the sign-in functionality using Choreo's managed authentication services. If you have further questions or need additional details, feel free to ask!"
How can I obtain user information claims in a web application using managed authentication?,"To obtain user information claims in a web application using Choreo's managed authentication, you can follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Implement Sign-In Functionality\nYou need to implement a sign-in button in your web application that redirects users to the `/auth/login` path. This button facilitates the authentication process with Choreo's identity provider. Here's a basic example using JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\n<button onClick={() => {window.location.href=""/auth/login""}}>Login</button>\n```\n\n### 2. Obtain User Information Claims\nOnce the user successfully signs in, you can access their information claims in two ways:\n\n#### A. Via the `userinfo` Cookie\nChoreo's managed authentication establishes a `userinfo` cookie upon successful sign-in. This cookie contains encoded user information claims, which can be accessed as follows:\n\n```javascript\nimport Cookies from 'js-cookie';\n\n// Read userinfo cookie value.\nconst encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo');\n\n// Decode the value.\nconst userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo));\n\n// Store the value in a preferred browser-based storage if needed.\n\n// Clear the cookie.\nCookies.remove('userinfo', { path: <post-login-path> });\n```\n\n**Note:**\n- The `userinfo` cookie has a short lifespan of 2 minutes.\n- It is important to securely store any user information retrieved.\n\n#### B. Via the GET Endpoint\nChoreo also provides a GET endpoint at `/auth/userinfo` to retrieve user claims. You can fetch this information as follows:\n\n```javascript\nconst response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo');\nif (response.ok) {\n    const userInfo = await response.json(); // Contains user information in JSON format\n} else {\n    // Handle unauthorized access\n}\n```\n\n**Response Codes:**\n- `200 OK`: User information is returned in JSON format.\n- `401 Unauthorized`: Indicates the user is not signed in.\n\n### 3. Additional Information\nEnsure you have configured the identity provider correctly and enabled managed authentication for your web application component. This setup is essential for the user claims retrieval functionality to work correctly.\n\nFor further details on setting up managed authentication and configuring identity providers, you can refer to the documentation: [Secure Web Applications with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/).\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively obtain user information claims in your Choreo-managed web application."
How do I handle session expiry in a web application with managed authentication?,"To manage session expiry in web applications utilizing Choreo's managed authentication, you can implement a few strategies to ensure that your application can gracefully handle session timeouts.\n\n### Handling Session Expiry\n\n1. **Session Expiry Notification**: When a user session exceeds the configured session expiry time, it automatically expires. If a user attempts to invoke a Choreo API after their session has expired, they will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response status. This indicates that the session may have expired and the user needs to re-login.\n\n2. **Automatic Re-login Logic**: You can implement logic to automatically redirect users to the login page when a `401 Unauthorized` response is detected. Here’s a sample code snippet that shows how to wrap your API requests with this re-login logic:\n\n   ```javascript\n   export const performGet = async (url) => {\n       try {\n           // Attempt to make the API call\n           return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>');\n       } catch (error) {\n           if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) {\n               // If a 401 error occurs, redirect to the login page\n               window.location.href = ""/auth/login"";\n           } else {\n               throw error; // For other errors, throw them to be handled elsewhere\n           }\n       }\n   };\n   ```\n\n3. **Configuring Session Expiry Time**: You can set the session expiry time during the deployment of your web application. It is essential to ensure that this value matches the refresh token expiry time of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) application you are using. During deployment, you can specify the session expiry time in minutes, with a default of 10080 minutes (7 days).\n\n4. **Custom Error Handling**: If you want to redirect users to a custom error page in case of session expiry or other errors, you can define a custom error path in your authentication settings. If an error occurs during the sign-in or sign-out process, Choreo will redirect users to this custom error page.\n\n### Summary\n\nBy implementing the automatic re-login logic and setting appropriate session expiry times, you can effectively manage session expirations in your web applications using Choreo's managed authentication.

What is the purpose of Personal Access Tokens (PATs)?,"Personal Access Tokens (PATs) in Choreo serve as a means to authorize access to your Git repositories and enhance security for API interactions. Here’s an overview of their purpose and usage:\n\n### Purpose of Personal Access Tokens (PATs)\n1. **Authorization**: PATs allow Choreo to perform actions on your behalf within your Git repository, providing the necessary permissions for both read and write operations.\n2. **Security Enhancement**: Using access tokens for request authorization helps prevent specific security threats, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, when accessing published APIs.\n\n### Usage of Personal Access Tokens\n- **For Git Repositories**:\n  - **GitLab**: By authorizing Choreo with a PAT obtained from your GitLab self-managed server, you grant permissions such as:\n    - **API Access**: Full read/write access to the API, covering all groups and projects.\n  - **Bitbucket**: When using a PAT from Bitbucket, the permissions granted include:\n    - **Account Information**: Access to user information and workspace details.\n    - **Repositories**: Ability to list branches and create branches to commit code.\n    - **Pull Requests**: The capability to create pull requests.\n    - **Webhooks**: Trigger automatic deployments and generate configurations.\n\n- **For API Access**:\n  - When registering an application in the Choreo Developer Portal, you can generate a PAT that includes a consumer key and secret. This acts as the application's identity, allowing it to authenticate API requests securely.\n\n### Generating a Personal Access Token\nTo generate a PAT, you usually register an application, which gives you the necessary keys to create the token. This token can then be included as part of the HTTP header requests for API access.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can visit the following links:\n- [Authorize self-managed GitLab with Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-components-with-git/#authorize-self-managed-gitlab-with-choreo)\n- [Authorize Bitbucket with Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-components-with-git/#authorize-bitbucket-with-choreo)\n- [Generate an Access Token](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/generate-an-access-token/)"
What are some use cases for personal access tokens?,"In Choreo, personal access tokens are primarily used for secure request authorization when accessing APIs. Here are some common use cases for personal access tokens:\n\n1. **API Access**: Personal access tokens are used by API consumers to authenticate requests. They are included as string values in HTTP header requests, allowing applications to securely interact with Choreo APIs.\n\n2. **Enhanced Security**: By using access tokens, the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on published APIs is reduced. This makes it a preferred method for securing API access.\n\n3. **Application Identity**: When you register an application in the Developer Portal, you can generate a consumer key and consumer secret that represent the application's identity. The consumer key serves as a unique identifier for the application, which is used to obtain an access token.\n\n4. **OAuth 2.0 Authorization**: Choreo utilizes OAuth 2.0 for authentication, and personal access tokens can be obtained through various grant types, allowing applications to securely access their resources or APIs. \n\n5. **Testing Purposes**: Developers can generate access tokens for testing their applications in a controlled environment. This allows for testing different functionalities without compromising security.\n\n6. **Role-Based Access Control**: Access tokens can be utilized in scenarios where role-based access control is implemented. This ensures that users can perform actions based on their roles and permissions within the application.\n\nFor a more detailed understanding of generating access tokens and their security implications, you can refer to the documentation here: [Generate an Access Token](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/generate-an-access-token/)."

How do I log in to the Choreo CLI using a personal access token?,"I'm sorry, but I do not have enough information to answer your question about logging into Choreo CLI using a personal access token. If you have any other questions or need assistance with a different topic, feel free to ask!"
How do I manage and revoke personal access tokens?,"In Choreo, managing and revoking personal access tokens primarily involves understanding the nature of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) used for authentication. Here's how you can effectively manage and revoke these tokens:\n\n### Managing Personal Access Tokens\n1. **Token Expiration**: It is advisable to set a short expiration time for access tokens—no longer than 15 minutes (900 seconds) by default in Choreo. This minimizes the risk if a token is stolen or leaked.\n   \n2. **Token Generation**: When you create an application in Choreo, you can generate credentials that include a consumer key and secret. These can be used to generate access tokens for API access.\n\n3. **Refresh Tokens**: Regularly refreshing access tokens reduces the potential impact of a compromised token. \n\n### Revoking Personal Access Tokens\nRevoking JWT access tokens is inherently challenging since they are self-validating. Traditional session-based authentication allows for easy revocation via session IDs, but JWTs do not have this capability. Here are some strategies:\n\n1. **Using Denylists or Allowlists**: To revoke a token, you might need to implement denylists (to block specific tokens) or allowlists (to permit only certain tokens). However, this approach can complicate the authentication process.\n\n2. **Short-Lived Tokens**: As mentioned, keeping tokens short-lived and refreshing them frequently is the best practice to mitigate risks associated with stolen tokens.\n\n3. **API Access**: To revoke an access token, you can invoke the designated revoke endpoint in your application settings.\n\nFor a step-by-step guide on generating tokens and managing credentials, you can refer to the [Choreo documentation on generating keys](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/create-an-application/#step-2-generate-keys). For detailed information on revoking access tokens, see the section on [revoking access tokens](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-application/#revoke-access-tokens). \n\nBy following these practices, you can effectively manage and revoke personal access tokens in Choreo."
What are the best practices for token management?,"To effectively manage tokens in the context of Choreo for securing APIs and integrations, consider the following best practices:\n\n1. **Use OAuth 2.0 for Authentication**: Implement OAuth 2.0 as it is a widely accepted standard for securing APIs. This method allows for secure authorization and token management while minimizing security risks.\n\n2. **Assign Scopes**: When creating APIs in Choreo, assign scopes that define what authenticated users can do. Scopes help manage permissions effectively and ensure that tokens are used according to the principle of least privilege.\n\n3. **Define Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Set up roles and permissions within Choreo. By mapping roles to user groups, you can ensure that only authorized groups can obtain access tokens with the necessary permissions. This can be managed in the Choreo Console under Application Security.\n\n4. **Use a Security Token Service**: Leverage Choreo's built-in security token service for generating access tokens. This service can manage token issuance, expiration, and revocation, simplifying the security management process.\n\n5. **Regularly Rotate Tokens**: Implement a strategy for token rotation to minimize the impact of token compromise. Regularly updating tokens can help maintain security over time.\n\n6. **Monitor and Audit Token Usage**: Utilize the observation and insights features within the Choreo Console to monitor API usage. This will help identify any suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts.\n\n7. **Secure Token Storage**: Ensure that tokens are stored securely and are not hard-coded in applications. Use environment variables or secure vaults for managing sensitive information.\n\n8. **Implement Token Expiration and Refresh**: Use short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens to enhance security. This approach minimizes the risk associated with long-lived tokens.\n\nFor more detailed guidance on securing APIs with Choreo, you can refer to the following documents:\n\n- [Secure API Access with Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-asgardeo/)\n- [Test Secure API Access with Choreo Built-In Security Token Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/test-secure-api-access-with-choreo-built-in-security-token-service/) \n\nThese resources provide step-by-step instructions and best practices for managing API security effectively within Choreo."
How does the Choreo Marketplace facilitate service reuse?,"Choreo Marketplace plays a significant role in facilitating the reuse and sharing of services within the Choreo platform. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. **Service Sharing**: The Choreo Marketplace allows users to share all services that are deployed within Choreo. This promotes a collaborative environment where services can be reused by different projects or teams.\n\n2. **Browsing and Searching**: Users can easily browse and search through the available services in the Marketplace. This includes access to service definitions, documentation, and instructions on how to use the services, making it easier to find and integrate existing services rather than creating new ones from scratch.\n\n3. **Service Addition**: When a service is deployed to an initial environment, it is automatically added to the Marketplace. Choreo collects essential details such as the component name, endpoint name, description, and service definitions during this deployment process. This automation ensures that services are readily available for reuse without additional manual effort.\n\n4. **Detailed Service Information**: Each service in the Marketplace can be explored in detail. The detailed service page includes:\n   - **Overview**: A summary provided by the service developer.\n   - **API Definition**: The API definition for the service.\n   - **How to Use**: Instructions on how to utilize the service, which can include creating connections to the service.\n   - **Related Documents**: Additional documentation that the service developer has provided.\n\n5. **Editing Services**: Users have the ability to edit services in the Marketplace. When services are redeployed, Choreo automatically updates their definitions, visibility, and descriptions, ensuring that the information remains current and useful for other users looking to reuse the services.\n\nBy providing a structured environment for service sharing, browsing, and detailed documentation, Choreo Marketplace enhances efficiency in building integrated applications, ultimately accelerating development cycles.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [Choreo Marketplace documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/choreo-marketplace/)."
How are services added to the Choreo Marketplace?,"To add services to the Choreo Marketplace, you can follow the steps outlined below:\n\n### Steps to Add a Service to the Choreo Marketplace\n\n1. **Deployment of the Service**:\n   - In Choreo, a service is termed a Choreo service, identifiable by an endpoint within a service component. \n   - When you deploy your service to the initial environment, it will automatically be added to the Marketplace. \n\n2. **Automatic Collection of Service Details**:\n   - During the deployment process, Choreo collects essential details such as:\n     - Component name\n     - Endpoint name\n     - Description\n     - Service definitions\n   - This information is utilized to generate the corresponding service entries in the Marketplace.\n\n3. **Naming Convention**:\n   - The service name in the Marketplace follows the convention of `component name - endpoint name`.\n\n### Additional Information\n- Each service showcased in the Marketplace corresponds to an endpoint within a service component.\n- If you need to manage or update the service details after deployment, you can do so through the Choreo Console.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/choreo-marketplace/#add-a-service-to-the-choreo-marketplace)."
What information is displayed when exploring a service in the Marketplace?,"\nWhen exploring a service in the Choreo Marketplace, you will find details about the API such as the name, version, type, title, description, endpoints, and a brief description of the API service. Additionally, you can view specific information about the API like the available endpoints, their functionalities, and how to interact with the API.

DELETE /books/{id}: Delete a reading list book by id\n- **API Description:** A simple REST API service written in Go\n\nIf you need more information about this API or any other service, please feel free to ask!"
How does Choreo handle service versioning in the Marketplace?,"In the Choreo Marketplace, service versioning is managed using a major version format based on semantic versioning principles. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Major Version Display**: Each service in the Choreo Marketplace is represented by its major version. For instance, if a service has versions `v1.0`, `v1.1`, `v1.2`, and `v2.0`, it will be displayed as `v1` and `v2` in the Marketplace, reflecting the latest versions `v1.2` and `v2.0`.\n\n2. **Automatic Updates**: When you deploy a new minor version of a service, the corresponding service in the Marketplace updates automatically to show the latest version within the same major version. For example, if service `Bar` is currently available as `v1` and the latest version within that range is `v1.2`, it will update to reflect `v1.3` once that version is released.\n\n3. **Intelligent Routing**: When using a service from the Marketplace as a dependency, Choreo automatically routes traffic from dependent services to the latest version of the service within the same major version. For example, if your component `Foo` connects to service `Bar` at version `v1`, and `Bar` updates to `v1.3`, traffic from `Foo` will automatically start routing to `Bar v1.3`.\n\nThis versioning method ensures that dependencies remain current without requiring manual updates for each release within a major version, making it easier to manage service updates and maintain compatibility.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the documentation on [Service versioning in the Choreo Marketplace](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/choreo-marketplace/#service-versioning-in-the-choreo-marketplace)."
How does Choreo ensure environment-specific configurations are separate from source code?,"Choreo manages environment-specific configurations separately from source code through a structured approach that ensures a clear separation between code and configuration. Here’s how this is done:\n\n### 1. **Environment-Specific Configurations**\nChoreo allows you to define configurations that are specific to each environment (e.g., development, staging, production). To manage these configurations:\n- Navigate to the **Deploy** page of your component.\n- Make the necessary changes via the specific environment card.\n- Trigger a new deployment to apply these changes.\n\n### 2. **Environment-Independent Configurations**\nIn addition to environment-specific configurations, Choreo also supports environment-independent configurations that apply to all environments. These can be modified in a similar manner by going to the **Set Up** card on the **Deploy** page and then deploying to the initial environment.\n\n### 3. **Configuration Injection at Runtime**\nChoreo injects the configurations and secrets at runtime, ensuring that:\n- The source code and built containers remain unchanged regardless of the environment.\n- Environment-specific configurations include resource credentials, external service credentials, and other necessary variables.\n\n### 4. **Secure Storage**\nAll configurations and secrets are encrypted both at rest and in transit, stored in secure vaults. This enhances security and ensures that sensitive information is protected.\n\n### 5. **Configuration Groups**\nChoreo also offers the ability to create Configuration Groups, which are collections of key-value pairs that can be reused across components. These groups can be linked to components during deployment, automatically resolving and mounting the configurations to the respective environments. \n\n### Conclusion\nThis structured approach ensures that configurations are managed effectively without mixing them with the source code, allowing for seamless deployments and enhanced security.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Configuration Management](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/configuration-management/)\n- [CI/CD](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#configurations)\n- [Manage Configuration Groups](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configuration-groups/)"
What security scans are performed during the build pipeline?,"During the build pipeline in Choreo, several important security scans are performed to ensure the integrity and security of the application being deployed. Here’s a comprehensive overview of the security scans conducted:\n\n1. **Dockerfile Scan**: \n   - Choreo checks if a non-root user ID is assigned to the Docker container. This is a security measure to prevent privilege escalation attacks. If no non-root user is specified in the Dockerfile, the build will fail.\n\n2. **Container Vulnerability Scan (using Aqua Trivy)**:\n   - This scan detects security vulnerabilities in the final Docker image. Trivy checks for vulnerabilities and if any critical vulnerabilities are found, it will cause the build to fail. However, vulnerabilities of lower severity levels are recorded but do not affect the build process.\n   - The build process will halt if critical vulnerabilities are detected, allowing developers to address these issues before deployment.\n\n3. **Third-party Libraries Scan**:\n   - In addition to scanning the Docker image, Choreo also scans third-party libraries included in the integration component for potential security vulnerabilities. Any critical vulnerabilities detected during this scan will also halt the deployment process.\n\nThese scans play a crucial role in identifying and mitigating security risks early in the development lifecycle, helping to prevent potential exploits and ensuring a secure deployment.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can check the following documentation:\n- [Deploy a Containerized Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/deploy-a-containerized-application/#deploy-the-containerized-component)\n- [CI/CD Overview](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#build)\n- [Work with the Micro Integrator Runtime](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/work-with-the-micro-integrator-runtime-in-choreo/#scan-third-party-libraries-to-identify-security-vulnerabilities)"
Can I manually trigger builds in Choreo?,"Yes, Choreo users can manually trigger builds. This can be done through the **Build** page in the Choreo console. Here's how you can manually trigger a build:\n\n1. Navigate to the **Build** page.\n2. Click on the **Build Latest** button. \n3. If needed, you can select a specific commit to build an image from that particular version.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that admin and Choreo DevOps users have the capability to trigger builds using specific tags from the connected Git repository. However, this approach should be used cautiously, as it can bypass the standard branch-based deployment process and potentially disrupt the deployment track integrity.\n\nIf you want to automate builds with each commit, you can enable the **Auto Build on Commit** feature.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#build)."
What is a component in Choreo and how is it related to a Git repository?,"In Choreo, a **component** represents a single unit of work within a cloud-native application. This could be a microservice, an API, or a job/task. Components serve as the basic unit of deployment in Choreo, allowing you to deploy, manage, and scale them independently. Each component is linked to a specific directory path in a Git repository, which contains either the source code or a Dockerfile with the necessary instructions for building the component.\n\nWhen you connect your Git repository to Choreo, it allows for the integration of your source code directly into the Choreo platform. You can either link to an existing repository or create a new one where you will commit your source code later. This integration supports various Git providers, such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab. \n\nBy attaching a component to a Git repository, you benefit from version control, collaboration, and automation capabilities that enhance your development workflow. The repository must contain either Ballerina source code or a Docker project, and it should include a Dockerfile if you are using it as a Docker project.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the documentation on components [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/component/) and on developing components with Git [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-components-with-git/)."
How does Choreo use Connections to integrate services?,"Choreo employs connections as a fundamental mechanism for integrating services both within its platform and with external resources. Here is an overview of how connections work in Choreo:\n\n### Types of Connections\n1. **Project Connections**: These are connections that can be shared across multiple components within a project. They are useful for services that require access to various components within the same project.\n   \n2. **Component Connections**: These connections are specific to a single component and cannot be used by other components. They are ideal for scenarios where a component needs to connect to a particular external service or legacy system.\n\n### Creating Connections\nTo integrate a service on Choreo:\n1. **Creating a Connection**:\n   - In the Choreo Console, you set the visibility level (project or component).\n   - You navigate to the **Dependencies** section and then to **Connections**.\n   - From there, you can create a new connection by selecting a service from the Marketplace, specifying details like name, description, access mode, and authentication scheme.\n\n2. **Connection Parameters**:\n   - Upon creating a connection, Choreo provides a Connection ID and connection parameters.\n   - You can configure your service to use this Connection ID and map the parameters to environment variable names in your component. These variables can then be accessed programmatically in your service implementation.\n\n3. **Dynamic Injection**:\n   - At runtime, Choreo dynamically injects values into the environment variables based on the configured mapping. This design promotes loose coupling, making it easier to maintain and modify connections without altering the service code.\n\n### Utilizing Connections\n- Services can utilize these connections to communicate with each other, share data, or perform actions seamlessly.\n- For instance, when a service needs to connect to another service, it leverages the Connection ID to retrieve the necessary parameters at runtime, allowing for smooth interaction without hardcoding sensitive information.\n\nIn summary, connections in Choreo enhance the ability to build integrated applications by allowing services to communicate effectively while maintaining flexibility and security. For further details on how to create and use connections, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Connections Overview](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/)\n- [Create a Connection](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/sharing-and-reusing/create-a-connection/)"
What is the difference between Project-level and Component-level Connections?,"In Choreo Console, there are two types of connections that you can create: **Project-level Connections** and **Component-level Connections**. Here's a detailed explanation of the differences between them:\n\n### Project-level Connections\n- **Scope**: These connections are created at the project level and can be used by any component within that specific project.\n- **Use Case**: Ideal for sharing third-party services, like Twilio, across multiple components within a project. For example, if you create a project connection to Twilio, all components in that project can use this same connection.\n- **OAuth Sharing**: If the project connections are configured to consume Choreo services under the OAuth security scheme, they will share the same OAuth application throughout the project. This means all components using the project connection will utilize the same client ID and client secret.\n\n### Component-level Connections\n- **Scope**: These connections are defined at the component level and are exclusive to that particular component.\n- **Use Case**: Suitable for scenarios where a specific component needs to connect to a service, such as a legacy service, without affecting other components. Each component can reference its own connection using the connection ID.\n- **OAuth Sharing**: Similar to project connections, if component connections are created to consume Choreo services under the OAuth security scheme, they can also share the same OAuth application by using the same client ID and secret among multiple component connections.\n\n### Summary\n- **Project-level Connections** allow for broader sharing across all components within a project, while **Component-level Connections** are specific to individual components.\n- Both types can utilize OAuth security but differ in their scope and usage context.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the official documentation on [Project Connections](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/#project-connections) and [Component Connections](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/connections/#component-connections)."
What is the difference between a cloud data plane and a private data plane?,"In the context of Choreo deployments, the main difference between a cloud data plane and a private data plane lies in their infrastructure and level of resource allocation.\n\n### Cloud Data Plane\n- **Infrastructure Model**: The cloud data plane utilizes a multi-tenanted infrastructure model. This means that user applications are deployed on a shared environment that is secure but serves multiple organizations.\n- **Resource Sharing**: Since it operates on shared infrastructure, the cloud data plane is designed to efficiently manage resources across different users while maintaining a level of isolation to ensure security.\n\n### Private Data Plane\n- **Infrastructure Model**: The private data plane provides dedicated infrastructure exclusively for a single organization. This allows organizations with specific requirements for data privacy and control to manage their applications in a more isolated environment.\n- **Resource Allocation**: With a private data plane, organizations have a dedicated setup that can be deployed on major cloud providers like Azure, AWS, or even on-premises. This ensures that all resources are solely for the organization's use, offering enhanced privacy and control.\n\n### Summary\n- **Cloud Data Plane**: Multi-tenant, shared infrastructure, suitable for general use cases.\n- **Private Data Plane**: Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization, providing more control and privacy.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [Data Planes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/data-planes/)."

What is the purpose of Deployment Tracks in Choreo?,"Deployment Tracks in Choreo serve as structured pathways for the deployment of software components, enhancing both organization and reliability throughout the deployment process. They are designed to provide practical solutions to improve the API consumer experience by addressing two primary challenges: streamlined deployment and efficient API versioning.\n\n### Purpose and Functionality of Deployment Tracks\n\n1. **Streamlined Deployment**:\n   - **CI/CD Integration**: Deployment Tracks are connected to specific branches within a GitHub repository, facilitating deployment to various environments. When a pull request (PR) is merged, it can automatically trigger a deployment to the development environment.\n   - **CD-Only Strategy**: For users who prefer to manage their own Continuous Integration (CI) systems, Deployment Tracks can be utilized as Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines. They can be linked to a container registry repository, allowing for seamless deployment of images directly from that repository.\n\n   ![Deployment tracks - source repo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks-source-repo.png)\n\n   ![Deployment tracks - container registry](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks-container-registry.png)\n\n2. **Efficient API Versioning**:\n   - Deployment Tracks provide a straightforward method for versioning APIs, which is particularly beneficial for managed APIs. They follow a versioning mechanism based on Semantic Versioning (SemVer), allowing developers to specify major and minor versions. This approach helps minimize disruption for API consumers while continuously deploying updates.\n   - Changes that do not introduce breaking modifications are categorized as patch updates, while major and minor versions are communicated to API consumers through the deployment tracks.\n\n   ![Deployment tracks - api versioning](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks-api-versioning.png)\n\nBy utilizing Deployment Tracks, developers can better manage and control the deployment process, ensuring that their components are deployed smoothly and effectively, while also maintaining clear versioning for API consumers.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [Deployment Tracks](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks/)."
How does Choreo's API versioning mechanism work?,"API versioning in Choreo is designed to efficiently manage and deliver different versions of APIs, particularly for service components. Here's an overview of how it works, along with best practices and features related to managing API versions:\n\n### Versioning Mechanism\n1. **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**: Choreo utilizes a versioning convention based on Semantic Versioning. The version format includes only the major and minor versions, prefixed with `v` (e.g., `v1.2`).\n   - **Major Version**: Incremented when there are incompatible changes to the API.\n   - **Minor Version**: Incremented when functionality is added in a backward-compatible manner.\n\n2. **Deployment Tracks**: Choreo provides a feature called Deployment Tracks that simplifies the management of API versions. Each deployment track can specify the major and minor versions of the API being delivered. This structure ensures that different versions can coexist and interact seamlessly, benefitting both API developers and consumers.\n\n### Best Practices\n- **Minimize Disruption**: When deploying updates, it is crucial to minimize disruption for API consumers. Changes that do not introduce breaking modifications are categorized as patch updates; these should ideally not affect clients.\n- **Communicate Changes**: While API consumers are primarily concerned with major version changes, it's important to communicate any minor version changes as they may still impact clients.\n- **Internal Versioning**: For internal tracking, developers can utilize Git tags or GitHub releases to manage versions effectively.\n\n### API Lifecycle Management\nChoreo also incorporates an API lifecycle management system that includes six distinct states: \n- **Created**\n- **Pre-released**\n- **Published**\n- **Blocked**\n- **Deprecated**\n- **Retired**\n\nThis lifecycle management allows API managers to optimize the development process and ensure that subscribers have access to the latest and most reliable versions of APIs.\n\n### Subscription Management\nWhen subscribing to an API, the subscription covers all minor versions within the API's major version. This means that when a new minor version is published, existing client applications can continue to function without disruption, as the invocation URL routes automatically to the latest minor version.\n\n### Visual Representation\nThe following image illustrates the API versioning approach in Choreo:\n\n![Deployment tracks - API versioning](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks-api-versioning.png)\n\nFor more detailed information on API versioning and lifecycle management in Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Efficient API Versioning](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks/#efficient-api-versioning)\n- [API Lifecycle Management](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/lifecycle-management/)"
What is an Endpoint in Choreo and what information does it define?,"In Choreo, an **Endpoint** is a network-exposed function that resides within a service or integration component. It acts as a unique entry point, allowing other services, integrations, or applications to interact with the component. Each service can expose multiple endpoints, such as REST and GraphQL endpoints, which provide different methods for communication.\n\n### Information Defined by an Endpoint\nAn endpoint in Choreo defines several key pieces of information that determine how it can be accessed and interacted with:\n\n1. **Name**: A unique identifier for the endpoint within the service component.\n2. **Port**: The network port on which the endpoint is accessible.\n3. **Type**: The protocol that the endpoint uses, which can be REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WS, UDP, or TCP.\n4. **Network Visibility**: This indicates the accessibility level of the endpoint:\n   - **Project**: Accessible only within the same project.\n   - **Organization**: Accessible by any component in the same organization.\n   - **Public**: Accessible by any client, regardless of location or organization.\n5. **Schema**: Specifies the structure and format of the data that can be exchanged through the endpoint, often represented using OpenAPI or GraphQL schema.\n6. **Context (for HTTP and GraphQL)**: A path that can be appended to the endpoint's URL for routing purposes.\n\nEndpoints facilitate the discovery and interaction of services in a standardized manner, allowing for effective API management and lifecycle management per endpoint.\n\nFor more details on endpoints in Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation links:\n- [Endpoint Overview](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/endpoint/)\n- [Configure Endpoints](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints-body/)"
What environments are typically offered in Choreo?,"In Choreo, the typical environments offered for deploying services and managing APIs are:\n\n1. **Development Environment**: This is used for initial deployments where you can test and validate your services before promoting them to production. It allows for experimentation and development without affecting live services.\n\n2. **Production Environment**: Once services are verified in the development environment, they can be promoted to the production environment. This environment is where the services are live and accessible to end users.\n\nChoreo provides these environments as part of a streamlined continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process. Each project in Choreo is provisioned with these two default environments. If you are using a private data plane, you have the flexibility to create and customize additional environments based on your specific requirements.\n\nChoreo adopts a *build once, deploy many* strategy, meaning that your application is built once and can be promoted to multiple environments as needed. This helps in maintaining a clear separation of environment-specific configurations from the source code, ensuring that all configurations and secrets are managed securely.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation links:\n- [CI/CD](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/)\n- [Manage Environments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-environments/)"
What is a project in Choreo?,"A project in Choreo is a logical grouping of related components that typically represent a single cloud-native application. Here are its key features and purposes:\n\n### Key Features of a Project in Choreo:\n1. **Logical Grouping**: Projects help organize related components, which may include APIs, integrations, microservices, and more.\n2. **Monorepo Architecture**: Components within a project can be stored in a single GitHub repository under different paths, allowing for a cohesive development approach.\n3. **Deployment**: At deployment time, all components within a project are deployed into a single namespace of the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring that they operate within a defined environment.\n4. **Access Control**: Components can be exposed to the public internet, made available internally to the organization, or kept private within the project, allowing for flexible access management.\n5. **Cell-Based Architecture**: Projects in Choreo are represented as cells, contributing to a structured and manageable deployment architecture.\n\n### Purposes of a Project in Choreo:\n- **Organizational Efficiency**: Projects facilitate better organization of work, making it easier to manage components and their relationships.\n- **Runtime Isolation**: By providing namespace isolation during deployment, projects ensure that components do not interfere with one another, enhancing stability and security.\n- **Enhanced Collaboration**: By allowing multiple components to be developed and managed together, projects support collaborative efforts across teams.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [Choreo Project Documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/project/)."
How are components deployed to environments?,"In Choreo, components are deployed to environments as part of a project. Here's a comprehensive overview of how this process works:\n\n1. **Components and Environments**: Each component you create is associated with a specific project, and environments are provisioned per project. When a component is deployed, it is packaged as a container and deployed to the specified environment. After deployment, you can promote the container image across the various environments available for that project.\n\n2. **CI/CD Process**: Choreo supports a streamlined continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process. It allows you to manage your deployments efficiently across multiple environments. Each project has its own environments, and these environments are isolated from one another, which means services deployed in one environment cannot communicate with services in another.\n\n3. **Build Once, Deploy Many**: Choreo adopts a ""build once, deploy many"" strategy. This means that an application is built only once (either automatically on each commit or manually based on a selected commit). After building, the component is promoted to other environments, allowing you to test changes in lower environments, like development, before moving to production.\n\n4. **Promoting Components**: To promote a component from one environment to another (e.g., from development to production), you typically need to request approval. You'll need to ensure that your component is built and deployed in the initial environment (development). The steps generally include:\n   - Selecting the component in the Choreo Console.\n   - Requesting to promote it to the desired environment (such as production).\n   - Providing necessary details in the approval request.\n\n5. **Redeploying a Release**: If you need to redeploy a component to a specific environment, you can do so by accessing the Runtime page and using the ""Redeploy Release"" option. This action will trigger a rolling update, syncing all the latest changes to the environment.\n\nFor further details, you can check the relevant documentation:\n- [Components and Environments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/resource-hierarchy/#components-and-environments)\n- [CI/CD](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/)\n- [Request Approval for Environment Promotion](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/submit-and-manage-workflow-approval-requests/#request-approval-for-environment-promotion)\n- [Redeploy a Release](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/view-runtime-details/#redeploy-a-release)"

How can I trigger automatic deployments using webhooks with the BYOI feature?,"To configure webhooks for automatic deployments using the Bring Your Own Image (BYOI) feature in Choreo, you need to follow a structured process that integrates your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline with Choreo. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Steps to Configure Webhooks for Automatic Deployments\n\n1. **Build and Push the Image**:\n   - Start by building and pushing the container image associated with your Choreo component to your preferred container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry).\n\n2. **Set Up External CI**:\n   - In the Choreo Console, navigate to the left menu and click on **DevOps**, then select **External CI**.\n   - Here, you need to generate a token for your CI pipeline from the **Manage Tokens** section. This token is essential for authenticating the webhook requests.\n   - **Important Note**: Ensure that the token is stored securely; for example, use GitHub secrets if you're utilizing GitHub Actions.\n\n3. **Trigger Automatic Deployment**:\n   - To trigger the deployment automatically, you will need to send an HTTP POST request to the Choreo webhook endpoint. This request should include the updated image details.\n   - You can also use the provided Webhook snippets in your CI pipeline to facilitate this process. \n\nThis integration allows you to leverage your existing CI setup to manage deployments in Choreo seamlessly.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- Ensure that you have a container registry set up and that your image is ready for deployment.\n- This feature is currently available only on private data planes (PDPs).\n\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to the official documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/bring-your-own-image/#auto-deploy-images-in-choreo-with-an-external-cibuild-pipeline). \n\nBy following these steps, you can efficiently configure webhooks to trigger automatic deployments in Choreo when using the BYOI feature."
How do I configure endpoints for services and integrations in Choreo?,"To configure endpoints for services and integrations in Choreo, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Understanding Endpoints\nEndpoints are crucial as they define how your service or integration is exposed to other services, integrations, or applications. Each endpoint can represent a unique entry point, and you can expose multiple endpoints for different purposes, such as REST and GraphQL APIs.\n\n### Key Attributes of Endpoints\nWhen configuring endpoints, you need to focus on several attributes:\n- **Name**: A unique identifier for the endpoint within the service component.\n- **Port**: The network port on which the endpoint is accessible.\n- **Type**: The protocol used by the endpoint (e.g., REST, GraphQL, gRPC, etc.).\n- **Network Visibility**: This determines who can access the endpoint (Project, Organization, or Public).\n- **Schema**: This specifies the structure and format of data exchanged through the endpoint.\n- **Context**: This is applicable for HTTP and GraphQL endpoints and allows you to add a context path for routing.\n\n### Configuring Endpoints\nThe method you use to configure endpoints can depend on the buildpack you are using. Here are the main approaches:\n\n1. **Using the Choreo Console**:\n   - If you do not have a `component.yaml` file, you can define a basic endpoint configuration when creating the component.\n\n2. **Using the `component.yaml` File**:\n   - Create a `component.yaml` file and place it in the `.choreo` directory at the build context path, then commit it to your source repository. This file allows you to manually define endpoint details.\n   - Note: If you need to define dynamic endpoint parameters (like variable ports), you must use the `component.yaml` file as automatic generation does not support these.\n\n3. **Exposing Service Endpoints** (for service components):\n   - After creating your service component, you can define the endpoints during a manual deployment:\n     1. In the left navigation menu, click **Deploy**.\n     2. Click **Update Image & Deploy** in the **Build Area** card.\n     3. In the **Endpoint** pane, you can define your service endpoints.\n     4. Click **Create/Update Endpoints**.\n     5. Edit the `endpoints.yaml` in the provided editor or upload the associated API specification/schema files.\n\nFor a detailed guide, refer to the [Configure Endpoints documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints/)."
What is the difference between ConfigMaps and Secrets?,"In Choreo, the distinction between ConfigMaps (referred to as configurations) and Secrets is crucial for managing sensitive data and application settings.\n\n### Configurations vs. Secrets\n\n1. **Configurations:**\n   - **Readability:** Configurations can be read and updated via the Choreo Console after they are created. This means you can easily access and modify the values as needed.\n   - **Use Cases:** Configurations are suitable for non-sensitive data such as application settings, feature toggles, and other parameters that do not require strict security.\n   - **Storage:** All configurations are stored in an encrypted vault, ensuring that unauthorized access is prevented.\n\n2. **Secrets:**\n   - **Write-Only:** Secrets are write-only. Once you create a secret, you cannot view or retrieve its content through the Choreo Console. However, you can overwrite the existing content at any time.\n   - **Use Cases:** Secrets are meant for sensitive information such as database passwords, API keys, cloud credentials, and other sensitive data. The recommendation is to use secrets for any data that requires confidentiality.\n   - **Security Implications:** Since secrets cannot be viewed after creation, they provide an added layer of security. This is particularly important for protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.\n\n### Security Implications\n- Both Configurations and Secrets are stored in an encrypted vault, either in the Choreo cloud data plane or in a private data plane environment (using Azure Key Vault or AWS Secret Manager).\n- The separation of configurations and secrets ensures that sensitive data is not exposed unnecessarily, thereby minimizing the risk of data leaks.\n\nWhen managing your application's configurations and secrets, it is essential to choose the appropriate type based on the sensitivity of the data you are handling.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation here: [Manage Configurations and Secrets](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#the-difference-between-configurations-and-secrets)."

How can I trigger automatic deployments using webhooks with the BYOI feature?,"To configure webhooks to trigger automatic deployments using the Bring Your Own Image (BYOI) feature in Choreo, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Build and Push Your Container Image**: Ensure that the container image associated with your Choreo component is built and pushed to your container registry.\n\n2. **Access DevOps Settings**: In the Choreo Console, navigate to the left menu and click on **DevOps**, then select **External CI**.\n\n3. **Generate a Token**: From the **Manage Tokens** section, generate a token that will be used by your CI pipeline. Make sure to store this token securely (e.g., as a GitHub secret if you are using GitHub Actions).\n\n4. **Set Up the Webhook**: To trigger the automatic deployment when a new image is available, you will need to send an HTTP POST request to the Choreo webhook endpoint. This request should contain the details of the updated image.\n\n5. **Webhook Configuration**: In your webhook component, you'll need to configure specific parameters, including a `webhookSecret` for security purposes and a notification email address.\n\n6. **Deploy the Webhook**: Deploy your webhook component using the Choreo Console. You can monitor the deployment progress and ensure that the status is marked as **Active** after completion.\n\n7. **Invoke the Webhook**: Once deployed, your CI pipeline can now trigger the webhook whenever a new image is pushed to the container registry. This will initiate an automatic deployment in Choreo.\n\nThis setup allows you to leverage your existing CI/CD processes while integrating seamlessly with Choreo for deployment purposes. \n\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to the following documentation links:\n- [Auto-deploy images in Choreo with an external CI/build pipeline](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/bring-your-own-image/#auto-deploy-images-in-choreo-with-an-external-cibuild-pipeline)\n- [Develop a Webhook](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-a-webhook/)"
What are the different authentication types for container registries in Choreo?,"Choreo supports several authentication types for connecting to container registries. Here are the different authentication options you can use:\n\n1. **Public (Anonymous) Access**: \n   - This option is for container registries that allow unrestricted public access. \n   - Only the registry host information is needed (e.g., `registry.hub.docker.com` for Docker Hub public repositories).\n\n2. **Basic Authentication**: \n   - This method requires a username and password to authenticate to the container registry.\n\n3. **Docker Config**: \n   - You can provide a Docker config in JSON format for authentication, but it only allows registering one container registry. \n   - The configuration must include credentials directly.\n\n   Sample format:\n   ```json\n   {\n       ""auths"": {\n           ""index.docker.io/v1/"": {\n               ""auth"": ""c3R...zE2""\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Vendor-Specific Authentication**: \n   - This option is used for private data planes and requires knowledge of the registry host. \n   - Here are some vendor-specific options:\n     - **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**: Service principal-based basic authentication.\n     - **Google Artifact Registry (GAR)**: Service account-based basic authentication using a JSON key.\n     - **AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**: Requires a dynamic access token but is managed internally if attached to an EKS cluster.\n     - **Docker Hub (Private)**: Basic authentication using Docker Hub credentials or a generated access token.\n     - **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**: Basic authentication using a Personal Access Token (PAT).\n\nThese authentication methods provide flexibility depending on the type of registry you are using and your specific requirements. For further details, you can refer to the documentation on [Registering a Container Registry](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/bring-your-own-image/#step-1-register-a-container-registry)."
How do I define endpoints for services and integrations in Choreo?,"In Choreo, defining endpoints for services and integrations is essential as it allows these components to be exposed to other services, integrations, or applications. Each service or integration can expose multiple endpoints, providing different ways to interact with it, such as REST API and GraphQL endpoints. \n\n### How to Define Endpoints\n\n1. **Endpoint Attributes**: When defining endpoints, you need to consider several attributes:\n    - **Name**: A unique identifier for the endpoint within the service.\n    - **Port**: The network port on which the endpoint is accessible.\n    - **Type**: The protocol used for the endpoint (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WS, UDP, TCP).\n    - **Network Visibility**: This determines who can access the endpoint:\n        - **Project**: Accessible within the same project.\n        - **Organization**: Accessible by any component within the organization.\n        - **Public**: Accessible by any client.\n    - **Schema**: The structure and format of data exchanged through the endpoint.\n    - **Context (for HTTP and GraphQL)**: A context path added to the endpoint's URL for routing.\n\n2. **Defining Endpoints in Choreo Console**:\n   - After creating a service or integration component, navigate to the **Define Endpoints** section.\n   - Enter a **Name** and the **Endpoint URL**.\n   - Add any **Additional Parameters** needed for connecting to the service (e.g., API key, authorization token).\n   - Select the environments where the endpoint should be accessible.\n   - Click **OK** to save the endpoint. You can add more endpoints as needed.\n   - Finally, click **Register** to make the service available in the Internal Marketplace.\n\n3. **Using a `component.yaml` File**:\n   - For buildpacks other than Ballerina and WSO2 MI, you can use a `component.yaml` file to manually configure your endpoint details. This file should be placed in the `.choreo` directory at the build context path and committed to the source repository. \n   - This method allows you to define dynamic endpoint parameters if needed.\n\n### Additional Information\n- If you're manually deploying a new image of a service component, you can define endpoints during the deployment process by editing the `endpoints.yaml` file or uploading the associated API specification/schema files.\n\nThese steps should help you define endpoints effectively within Choreo. For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the following links:\n- [Configure Endpoints](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints/)\n- [Register a Third-Party Service in Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/integrate-and-manage-external-services/integrate-and-manage-third-party-services/#register-a-third-party-service-in-choreo)\n- [Bring Your Own Image (BYOI)](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/bring-your-own-image/#step-4-expose-service-endpoints)"

What is the difference between liveness and readiness probes?,"In the context of Choreo deployments, liveness and readiness probes serve different purposes for managing the health of your containerized applications.\n\n### Liveness Probes\n- **Purpose**: Liveness probes are designed to check if your application is running properly. If the liveness probe fails, the container is restarted automatically. This is particularly useful for scenarios where the application may have crashed or become unresponsive, allowing the system to self-heal.\n- **Behavior**: These probes run periodically and will trigger a restart of the container if they indicate that the application is not healthy.\n\n### Readiness Probes\n- **Purpose**: Readiness probes determine if your application is ready to handle requests. If a readiness probe fails, the container will stop receiving network traffic, but it will not be restarted. This is useful for ensuring that traffic is only directed to containers that are fully initialized and capable of processing requests.\n- **Behavior**: These probes also run periodically but focus on stopping traffic to the container rather than restarting it.\n\n### Key Differences\n- **Restart Behavior**: Liveness probes restart the container upon failure, while readiness probes only prevent traffic from reaching the container.\n- **Traffic Management**: Readiness probes are crucial for managing incoming requests and ensuring that only healthy instances serve traffic, while liveness probes focus on overall container health.\n\nBy implementing both probes, you can effectively monitor and manage the state of your applications within Choreo, ensuring high availability and reliability.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation links:\n- [Set Up Health Checks - Liveness Probes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#liveness-probes)\n- [Set Up Health Checks - Readiness Probes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#readiness-probes)"
What probe types are available in Choreo?,"In Choreo, you can configure the following probe types for monitoring and observability purposes, specifically for readiness and liveness checks:\n\n1. **HTTP `GET` Request**: \n   - This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on the container. \n   - A response status code in the range of 200-399 indicates a successful request.\n   - Additional HTTP headers can be configured as needed. \n   - It is recommended to create a `/healthz` or `/health` endpoint in your service for this purpose.\n\n   ![HTTP GET probe](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/devops-and-ci-cd/healthchecks/http-get-probe.png)\n\n2. **TCP Connection Probe**: \n   - This probe attempts to open a socket to the container on the specified port. \n   - If it cannot establish a TCP connection, it is considered a failure.\n\n3. **Execute a Command**: \n   - This probe executes a given script inside the container.\n   - A non-zero return from the command is considered a failure. \n   - For example, `[""cat"", ""/tmp/healthy""]` is considered healthy if the file `/tmp/healthy` is present; otherwise, it results in a failure (non-zero exit code).\n\nThese probe types are essential for ensuring that your services are responsive and functioning correctly in the deployed environment.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the documentation here: [Probe types](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#probe-types)."

What is the purpose of autoscaling component replicas?,"The purpose of autoscaling component replicas in Choreo is to ensure high availability and efficient resource utilization for applications or services deployed on the platform. Autoscaling allows you to automatically adjust the number of active replicas of your components based on resource consumption metrics, such as CPU and memory utilization. This means that as demand fluctuates, Choreo can scale the number of replicas up or down accordingly.\n\n### Benefits of Autoscaling:\n1. **High Availability**: By scaling replicas, your service can handle varying loads, ensuring that it remains responsive even during peak usage times.\n2. **Resource Efficiency**: Autoscaling optimizes the use of resources by minimizing costs. For instance, during low traffic, fewer replicas can be maintained, thus consuming less infrastructure.\n3. **Dynamic Response to Load**: The system can automatically increase the number of replicas when resource thresholds are reached, allowing it to adapt to sudden spikes in usage without manual intervention.\n4. **Lower Infrastructure Costs**: Particularly in environments where the load is variable, autoscaling can significantly reduce costs by scaling down idle workloads.\n\n### Key Parameters for Scaling:\n- **Min Replicas**: The minimum number of replicas that should be maintained at all times. It is recommended to set this to at least `2`.\n- **Max Replicas**: The maximum number of replicas to scale up to. For cloud data planes, this is restricted to a maximum of `5`, while there is no restriction in private data planes.\n- **CPU and Memory Thresholds**: These thresholds determine when to scale up replicas. If the average CPU or memory usage exceeds the set threshold, additional replicas will be created until usage falls below the threshold.\n\n### Scale-to-Zero Feature:\nChoreo also provides a scale-to-zero feature for HTTP applications, allowing them to scale down to zero when there is no traffic. This is particularly useful for reducing costs in lower environments. When a request is received, the application quickly scales up from zero to handle the load, making it a flexible solution for managing resources effectively.\n\nFor more detailed information on autoscaling component replicas, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-component-replicas/). Additionally, for insights into the scale-to-zero functionality, check out this link: [Scale-to-Zero](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/)."
How does scale-to-zero work in Choreo?,"The scale-to-zero feature in Choreo is designed to optimize resource utilization for HTTP applications and services by automatically scaling down to zero when there is no incoming traffic. This feature is particularly beneficial in reducing infrastructure costs, especially in lower environments where workloads may be idle for extended periods.\n\n### How Scale-to-Zero Works:\n1. **Automatic Scaling**: When enabled, your application will scale down to zero replicas if it does not receive any HTTP traffic. Upon receiving an HTTP request, the application scales up from zero to handle the request, starting with one replica.\n2. **Idle Timeout**: If the application remains idle (i.e., no requests) for approximately 5 minutes, it will automatically scale back down to zero. This process ensures that resources are not unnecessarily consumed when the application is not in use.\n3. **Dynamic Scaling**: The application can dynamically scale up to meet high traffic demands, up to a specified maximum number of replicas. If the number of pending requests exceeds the defined threshold (default is set to 100), Choreo will add additional replicas to handle the increased load.\n\n### Benefits:\n- **Cost Efficiency**: By scaling down idle workloads to zero, it significantly reduces operational costs, especially in development and testing environments.\n- **Resource Optimization**: It allows efficient use of resources by ensuring that components are only active when needed.\n\n### Implementation Details:\n- **Supported Applications**: The scale-to-zero feature is only available for HTTP applications and web services. It does not support TCP or HTTPS services.\n- **Port Requirements**: For your HTTP service to utilize scale-to-zero, it must be deployed on specific ports (e.g., 5000, 6000, 7000, etc.). Services running on unsupported ports will not scale to zero.\n- **Proxy Service**: When your application is scaled down, an intermediary proxy service holds incoming requests. This proxy intercepts requests and queues them until the application scales back up, after which the requests are forwarded to the application.\n- **Initial Delay**: The first request after a period of inactivity may experience delays due to the scaling process. If your application is part of a service chain, the waiting time may extend further.\n\n### Limitations:\n- Scheduled tasks and manually triggered components cannot connect to a service on a project scope if scale-to-zero is enabled; they must be set to HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) mode or no scaling mode.\n\nFor more detailed information on the scale-to-zero feature, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/#how-scale-to-zero-works-in-choreo)."
How do I enable scale-to-zero?,"To enable scale-to-zero for your services or applications in Choreo, follow these steps based on the type of user and the creation date of your component:\n\n### For Components Created After February 23, 2024\n- The scale-to-zero feature is enabled by default. When you deploy or promote your service or web-app, it will automatically scale to zero. Upon receiving the next HTTP request, a replica will be created to serve the request.\n\n### For Components Created Before February 23, 2024\n1. **Go to the Component**: In the **Component Listing** pane, select the component that you want to enable scale-to-zero for.\n2. **Ensure Deployment**: Make sure the component is deployed to an environment and is ready to receive traffic.\n3. **Access Scaling Settings**:\n   - In the left navigation menu, click on **DevOps** and then select **Scaling**.\n4. **Enable Scale-to-Zero**:\n   - **Free Users**: You will see a scale-to-zero card. Click on it to enable the feature.\n     ![Free User - Scale to Zero](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/devops-and-ci-cd/scaling/free-user-scaling-view.png)\n   - **Paid Users or Private Data Plane**: You will also see a similar scale-to-zero card. Click on it to enable the feature.\n     ![Paid User - Scale to Zero](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/devops-and-ci-cd/scaling/paid-user-scaling-view.png)\n\n### Important Notes\n- The scale-to-zero feature only supports web applications and HTTP services running on specific ports (5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, and others listed in the documentation). If your service does not meet these requirements, it will not scale to zero.\n- After enabling scale-to-zero, your application will scale down to zero replicas during idle periods and will scale up to one replica upon receiving a new request. The minimum replicas will be set to zero, but you can specify a maximum number of replicas.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/#enable-scale-to-zero)."
What are the limitations of scale-to-zero?,"The scale-to-zero feature in Choreo allows web applications and HTTP services to automatically scale down to zero when they are not in use, which helps reduce costs for idle workloads. However, there are several limitations to be aware of:\n\n1. **Supported Services**: The scale-to-zero feature currently supports only web applications and HTTP services. It does not support TCP and HTTPS services.\n\n2. **Port Restrictions**: For an HTTP service to scale to zero, it must be running on specific ports. These ports include:\n   - 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000\n   - 7070 to 7079\n   - 8080 to 8089\n   - 9090 to 9099\n   - 8290  \n   If your service is running on any other port, it will not automatically scale to zero upon deployment or promotion.\n\n3. **Scheduled Tasks and Manual Triggers**: Scheduled tasks and manually triggered components cannot connect to a service in a project scope if scale-to-zero is enabled. If you attempt this, you will encounter the error:  \n   `Host not found, not forwarding request.`  \n   To resolve this, you can set the task-type component to Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) mode if you are on a paid plan, or to no scaling if you are using the Developer plan.\n\nThese limitations can affect how you deploy and manage your services in Choreo.

What is the formula for estimating the maximum number of connections for a Choreo-Managed Cache?,"The formula for estimating the maximum number of connections for a Choreo-Managed Cache is:\n\n```\nmax_number_of_connections = 4 x m\n```\n\nIn this formula, `m` represents the memory in megabytes. This means that at least 10,000 connections are available, even on the smallest servers. For example, if you have a server with 4GB of memory (which is 4,096 MB), the estimated maximum number of simultaneous connections would be:\n\n```\n4 x 4096 = 16384 // 16k connections\n```\n\nIt's important to note that this number is an estimate based on the exact available memory, and it can vary between different plans and cloud providers. If you wish to see the exact maximum connections allowed, you can utilize the `redis-cli` with the following command:\n\n```\necho ""info"" | redis-cli -u REDIS_URI | grep maxclients\n```\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [Choreo-Managed Cache Limitations](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/manage-databases-and-caches/choreo-managed-caches/#limitations)."

What is the difference between HTTP and TCP probes?,"In the context of monitoring and observability within Choreo, HTTP and TCP probes serve different purposes for assessing the health of your services. Here's a detailed comparison:\n\n### HTTP Probes\n- **Type**: This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on your service.\n- **Success Criteria**: A successful probe is indicated by a response status code in the range of 200-399. This means that the service is operational and able to respond to HTTP requests.\n- **Configuration**: You can configure additional HTTP headers based on your requirements. It is recommended to create a dedicated endpoint, such as `/healthz` or `/health`, to handle these probes. This allows for more straightforward health checks tailored to your service's needs.\n- **Use Case**: Ideal for services that rely on HTTP protocols and need to verify that their endpoints are reachable and responsive.\n\n### TCP Probes\n- **Type**: This probe attempts to establish a TCP connection to the container on a specified port.\n- **Success Criteria**: If the probe cannot establish a TCP connection, it is considered a failure. There are no specific response codes to interpret; the ability to open a socket is the sole indicator of health.\n- **Use Case**: Useful for services where TCP connectivity is crucial, regardless of whether an HTTP service is running. This is particularly relevant for non-HTTP protocols or for checking if the service is up and accepting connections.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, HTTP probes are focused on the application level, checking if specific endpoints are responding correctly, while TCP probes are concerned with the network level, ensuring that a service is reachable on a specified port. Depending on your service architecture and requirements, you may choose to implement one or both types of probes for comprehensive health monitoring.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [Probe Types](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#probe-types)."

What does deployment frequency represent in Choreo's DORA metrics?,"In the context of Choreo's DORA metrics, **deployment frequency** is defined as the rate at which an organization successfully releases components to production. This metric specifically counts the number of times a component is deployed to the production environment and does not include deployments made to development or lower environments.\n\n### Key Points about Deployment Frequency:\n- **Measurement**: Deployment frequency is dynamically determined and presented in the nearest time measurement. For instance, if there are multiple deployments within a day, it is measured as ""deployments per day."" Conversely, if deployments are less frequent, it may be measured as ""deployments per week.""\n- **Indicators of Efficiency**: A lower deployment frequency can indicate inefficiencies within the organization, prompting a need to evaluate and improve processes to facilitate more frequent releases.\n- **Data Presentation**: Choreo provides a snapshot view showing total deployments for a selected time range along with the percentage change compared to the previous period.\n  \n### Visualization:\n1. **Snapshot View**: Provides a quick overview of deployment frequency across all components in the selected organization.\n   ![Deployment Frequency Snapshot](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/engineering-insights/deployment-frequency-snapshot.png)\n\n2. **Time Series View**: Displays deployment counts over a selected time period in a bar chart format.

What is the Lead Time for Change metric?,"I'm sorry, but I can only provide assistance with metrics related to traffic/usage, errors, and latency of APIs or services. If you have any questions about these topics, feel free to ask!"
What does the Change failure rate metric represent in Choreo?,"The Change Failure Rate metric in Choreo represents the percentage of deployments that cause a failure in production. Specifically, it is calculated as the ratio of failed deployments to the total number of deployments. A deployment is considered a failure if there is at least one incident reported against it after the deployment. Importantly, any failures that occur at deployment time are not counted as production failures since they do not impact the end user.\n\n### Calculation and Usage:\n- **Formula**: \n  \[\n  \text{Change Failure Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of failed deployments}}{\text{Total number of deployments}} \right) \times 100\n  \]\n\n- **Incident Reporting**: For accurate measurement of this metric, organizations are encouraged to properly report incidents. This helps Choreo identify which deployments have resulted in production failures.\n\n- **Time Frame Consideration**: When evaluating the Change Failure Rate for a specific period (e.g., January 2023), Choreo considers:\n  - All deployments that occurred within that timeframe.\n  - Any incidents reported at any time against those deployments, even if reported after the period ends.\n\n### Visualization:\nChoreo provides two views to visualize the Change Failure Rate:\n\n1. **Snapshot View**: This view shows the Change Failure Rate as a percentage for the selected time period and helps leadership assess the quality of deliverables. A higher rate may indicate the need for improved processes to enhance quality assurance, such as better code coverage and testing.\n\n   ![Change Failure Rate Snapshot](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/engineering-insights/change-failure-rate-summary.png)\n\n2. **Time Series View**: This view displays the Change Failure Rate over time, allowing identification of trends and the effects of process changes on quality. It can help pinpoint periods with higher failure rates, such as when new changes are introduced.\n\n   ![Change Failure Rate Time Series](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/monitoring-and-insights/engineering-insights/change-failure-rate-chart.png)\n\nIn summary, the Change Failure Rate metric is a critical performance indicator in Choreo that enables organizations to measure the effectiveness and quality of their deployment processes. For further details, you can refer to the official documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/monitoring-and-insights/delivery-insights/view-dora-metrics/#change-failure-rate)."
What is the Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) metric?,"The Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) metric is defined by the DORA team as the time it takes for an organization to recover from a production failure. In the context of Choreo, MTTR measures the time from the identification of a production incident to its resolution. This metric is crucial as it reflects the responsiveness and agility of the incident management teams.\n\nTo ensure accurate MTTR metrics, organizations must effectively manage incident tickets in their incident management systems, updating and closing them in accordance with established process guidelines. The MTTR metric can be visualized in Choreo's observability dashboard, which offers insights into how quickly teams can recover from incidents.\n\n### Visualization of MTTR\n1. **Snapshot View**: \n   - This view displays the mean recovery time for a selected period and adjusts the time unit dynamically for better readability. It helps organizations evaluate the response time and agility of their incident handling teams, indicating overall stability.

This mapping will now provide all users in this group with the permissions defined by the assigned role within the context of the project.\n\n### Step 4: Add Users to the Group\nYou can add users to the group either by inviting new users or adding existing users:\n- **To invite new users**:\n  1. Go to the **Users** tab under the **Access Control** section.\n  2. Click **+Invite Users** and specify the email addresses.\n  3. Choose the `Engineering Project Developer` group from the **Groups** list and click **Invite**.\n  \n- **To add existing users**:\n  1. Search for the user in the **Users** tab.\n  2. Click the edit icon next to the user and select **+Assign Groups**.\n  3. Choose `Engineering Project Developer` and click **Add**.\n\n### Important Notes\n- Users in a group inherit permissions from the roles assigned to that group.\n- Avoid assigning multiple roles to a single user across different projects or levels to prevent unintended permissions.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, refer to the relevant documentation: [Control Access in the Choreo Console](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/control-access-in-the-choreo-console/#sample-scenario)."
How do I define users and assign them to groups?,"In Choreo, managing users and assigning them to groups involves defining user roles and creating groups that can inherit these roles. Here's how you can define users and assign them to groups, along with details on the user management and group assignment processes:\n\n### User Management in Choreo\n\n1. **Roles**: Choreo roles define a set of permissions. There are predefined roles in Choreo such as:\n   - **API Publisher**: Can manage APIs (create, publish, delete).\n   - **API Subscriber**: Can subscribe to applications and manage subscriptions.\n   - **Admin**: Responsible for administration tasks, including user management.\n   - **Developer**: Can develop and manage cloud-native applications.\n\n2. **Groups**: A group is a collection of users who share similar roles. When you assign a role to a group, all users in that group inherit the permissions associated with that role. Predefined groups include:\n   - **API Publisher**\n   - **API Subscriber**\n   - **Admin**\n   - **Developer**\n\n### Assigning Users to Groups\n\nTo assign users to groups, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a Group**: \n   - In the Choreo Console, navigate to the **Settings** section.\n   - Click on the **Access Control** tab and then the **Groups** tab.\n   - Click **+ Create Group**, enter the group name and description, and click **Create**.\n\n2. **Assign Roles to the Group**: \n   - After creating the group, you need to assign roles to it.\n   - In the **Groups** tab, find your group and click the edit icon.\n   - Click **+Add Roles**, select the appropriate roles, and click **Add**.\n\n3. **Add Users to the Group**:\n   - To add existing users, navigate to the **Users** tab under **Access Control**.\n   - Search for the user you want to add, click the edit icon next to their name, and select the group to which you want to add them.\n   - If inviting new users, click **+Invite Users**, enter their email addresses, select the group, and click **Invite**.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n- Ensure that roles assigned to groups are appropriate for the level of access needed within the organization or specific project.\n- Avoid assigning multiple roles to a single user across different projects to prevent unintended access.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy managing users and their roles through groups, you can efficiently control access and permissions in Choreo, ensuring that users have the necessary permissions to perform their tasks while maintaining security.\n\nFor more detailed steps, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Manage user permission](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/organization/#manage-user-permission)\n- [Control Access in the Choreo Console](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/control-access-in-the-choreo-console/)"
How do I obtain an access token and try out the API?,"To obtain an access token in Choreo and try out an API using this access token, follow these steps:\n\n### Steps to Obtain an Access Token\n\n1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have:\n   - An application registered in the [Choreo Developer Portal](https://devportal.choreo.dev).\n   - Generated keys for the application.\n   - Subscribed to the APIs you want to access.\n\n2. **Generate the Access Token**:\n   - Navigate to the **Choreo Developer Portal** and click on **Applications** in the header.\n   - On the **My Applications** page, select the application for which you want to generate keys and tokens.\n   - In the left navigation menu, click on the desired environment under **Credentials**. This will display the **Application Keys** pane for that environment.\n   - Click on **Generate Token** to create a test access token.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on generating an access token [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/generate-an-access-token/#generate-an-access-token-via-the-developer-portal-ui-for-testing).\n\n### Steps to Try Out an API Using the Access Token\n\nOnce you have the access token, you can use it to invoke the API:\n\n1. **Authorization**: Include the access token in the HTTP header of your API requests. Typically, you would include it as:\n   ```\n   Authorization: Bearer <access_token>\n   ```\n\n2. **Making API Requests**: You can now call the API endpoints you have access to. For example, if you have permissions to access user data, you might use:\n   - `GET /users`\n   - `GET /users/{userID}`\n\n3. **Testing**: Use tools like Postman or cURL to test the API endpoints with the access token included in the header. For example:\n   ```sh\n   curl -H ""Authorization: Bearer <access_token>"" https://api.yourservice.com/users\n   ```\n\n4. **Scope Validation**: Be aware that your access to certain API resources may depend on the roles and permissions associated with the access token. If you attempt to access resources outside your permissions, you may encounter a scope validation error.\n\nFor further details on consuming OAuth2 secured services, you can check the document [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/consuming-a-sevice-oauth2/#generate-an-access-token-via-the-developer-portal-ui-for-testing).\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully obtain an access token and use it to interact with your API in Choreo."

Resource limits are enforced to ensure that no single component consumes an excessive amount of resources, which could impact other workloads on the data plane. If a process exceeds its allocated memory limit, the container will be shut down and restarted. If it exceeds the CPU limit, it will be throttled, potentially causing latency in compute and I/O operations.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Choreo Cloud Data Plane Limits](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/references/choreo-limitations/#choreo-cloud-data-plane-limits)\n- [Limitations for Building and Deploying Web Applications](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-web-applications/build-and-deploy-a-single-page-web-application/#limitations)\n- [Configure Container Resources, Commands, and Arguments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/configure-container-resources-commands-and-arguments/)"
How does Choreo bill for platform services?,"The billing model for platform services in Choreo is based on two primary structures: **hourly billing** and **fixed pricing**. Here are the key points to consider:\n\n### 1. Hourly Billing\n- **Usage-Based:** You are billed based on the number of hours a resource is active. For instance, if you create a database, cache, or Kafka service and remove it within the same month, you will only pay for the hours it was active.\n\n### 2. Fixed Pricing\n- **Service Plans:** Pricing varies according to the selected service plan. Choreo does not charge extra for network bandwidth usage, which means you can use the services without worrying about additional costs related to data transfer.\n\n### 3. Service Types\n- Choreo allows you to create various platform services such as:\n  - **Databases:** PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.\n  - **Caches:** Choreo-managed cache instances.\n  - **Kafka Services:** Managed Apache Kafka services across major cloud providers.\n\n### 4. Payment Considerations\n- The billing for platform services is incorporated into your existing subscription with Choreo. Costs are determined by the specific service plan and the amount of resources utilized.\n\n### 5. Upgrade Options\n- If you wish to upgrade your service plan, you will need to contact Choreo support for assistance.\n\nIt is important to be aware that the capability to create Choreo-managed databases, caches, and Kafka services is available only to paid Choreo users.

How to manage Ballerina configurables?,"To manage Ballerina configurables in the Choreo platform, you can follow these key steps:\n\n1. **Deployment Page Access**: When you deploy or promote your Ballerina application, you can modify the Ballerina configurables in the **Deploy** page of the Choreo console.\n\n2. **Using Configurables**: Choreo allows you to utilize configurables instead of environment variables to add file mounts to your Ballerina component. This is particularly useful for managing configuration data specific to Ballerina applications.\n\n3. **Immutable Configurations**: Once you deploy a component with specific configurations, those configurations become immutable. Any changes made afterward will require a new deployment.\n\n4. **Configuration Management**: Choreo provides a setup area during the deployment phase where it merges the Docker image with its environment-independent configurations. This ensures that the correct configurations are applied to your Ballerina component.\n\n5. **Versioning and Secrets**: You can manage and version your component's configurations and secrets as file mounts or environment variables. Note that all configurations and secrets are stored in an encrypted vault for security. For sensitive data, such as passwords, it is recommended to use secrets instead of configurations.\n\n6. **Environment Check**: Choreo verifies the configurables defined in your source code against the values applied in your environment. If there are discrepancies, it may cause auto-build pipelines to fail to prevent runtime errors.\n\nFor more detailed information about managing Ballerina configurables, you can refer to the relevant documentation here: [Manage Ballerina Configurables](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#manage-ballerina-configurables)."
What is an organization in Choreo?,"In Choreo, an organization is defined as a logical grouping of users and their resources. This concept is essential because it helps structure how users interact with the platform and manage their resources effectively. \n\n### Role of an Organization in Choreo:\n1. **User Grouping**: An organization serves as a container for users, allowing for organized collaboration and resource management. This is particularly useful for teams or companies working together on projects.\n   \n2. **Membership Control**: When a user first signs in to Choreo, they must create an organization and become a member of it. This ensures that all users operate within a controlled environment where access can be managed.\n\n3. **Resource Access**: Resources within an organization are isolated from those in other organizations. Users and resources in one organization cannot access resources in another unless they are invited and added as a member by an admin of the other organization. This enhances security and resource management.\n\n4. **Role Assignment**: Organizations can assign different roles to users, which helps control access to various Choreo features. This means that within an organization, different users can have varying levels of access and capabilities depending on their assigned roles.\n\n5. **Unique Identifier**: Each organization has a unique identifier and handle, which helps in distinguishing it from others within the platform.\n\nIn summary, organizations in Choreo play a critical role in managing users and resources, ensuring security and organized collaboration, and facilitating the assignment of roles for effective access control.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [Organization documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/organization/)."
What is a project in Choreo?,"In Choreo, a project is defined as a logical group of related components that typically represent a single cloud-native application. Each project consists of one or more components, which can be organized within a single GitHub repository under different paths, a structure often referred to as the monorepo architecture.\n\nWhen you deploy a project, all components within that project are deployed into a single namespace in the Kubernetes cluster. Furthermore, these components can have varying exposure levels; they can be accessible to the public internet, restricted to your organization, or kept private within the project itself.\n\nA project in Choreo is also represented as a cell in the context of a cell-based architecture, which emphasizes the modular and scalable nature of applications.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/project/)."
What is a component in Choreo?,"In Choreo, a **component** represents a single unit of work within a cloud-native application. It typically corresponds to a microservice, API, or job/task. Each component is linked to a specific directory path in a Git repository, which contains either the program's source code or a Dockerfile with the necessary build instructions. Components serve as the primary unit of deployment in Choreo, meaning that they can be deployed, managed, and scaled independently within the Kubernetes cluster.\n\nChoreo supports various component types tailored for different use cases, including:\n\n- **Services**: These encapsulate business logic and provide standardized interfaces (endpoints) for communication with other components or external systems. They can be deployed and scaled independently, enhancing flexibility and adaptability to changing workloads.\n\n- **API Proxies**: These act as intermediaries for API requests, providing additional functionalities such as security and traffic management.\n\n- **Integrations**: These facilitate interactions between different services or systems, enabling data exchange and process automation.\n\n- **Web Applications**: These components can host user-facing applications.\n\nEach component in Choreo can expose one or more endpoints, which are defined as network-exposed functions that allow other services, integrations, or applications to interact with the component. Each endpoint can support different protocols (like REST, GraphQL, gRPC, etc.) and can have specific configurations related to visibility, schema, and other attributes.\n\nBy leveraging components, developers can effectively manage and orchestrate services, APIs, and integrations, creating robust and complex software systems that can evolve with changing requirements.\n\nFor more detailed information on components in Choreo, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/component/)."
How do I uninstall CLI?,"To uninstall the Choreo CLI, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. If you did not download the binary directly, simply delete the `.choreo` directory located in the home directory of your operating system.\n\nThis action will effectively remove the Choreo CLI from your system.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the FAQ section regarding the Choreo CLI [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/references/faq/#choreo-cli)."
How to set up automatic scaling for my applications?,"To configure automatic scaling for applications in Choreo, you can utilize the ""Scale to Zero"" feature, which allows your applications to scale down to zero replicas when idle and automatically scale up when requests are received. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n### Enabling Scale to Zero\n\n1. **Default Behavior**: For service components and web apps created after February 23, 2024, the scale-to-zero feature is enabled by default. When these components are deployed, they automatically scale down to zero when not in use and scale back up upon receiving traffic.\n\n2. **For Older Components**:\n   - If you have service components created before February 23, 2024, you can enable scale-to-zero manually:\n     1. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component you wish to configure.\n     2. Ensure that the component is deployed and ready to receive traffic.\n     3. Navigate to **DevOps** > **Scaling**.\n     4. Click on the **scale-to-zero** card to enable this feature.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n- **Network Visibility**: Components with at least one endpoint set to **Project** visibility will not automatically scale to zero.\n- **Port Limitations**: HTTP services running on ports other than the specified range (5000, 6000, 7000, ... up to 9099) will not scale to zero automatically.\n- **Minimum and Maximum Replicas**: When enabling scale to zero, the minimum replicas are set to zero, but you can define a maximum number of replicas to handle increased traffic.\n\n### Additional Scaling Options\n\nFor environments where you need more precise control over scaling:\n- **Autoscale Component Replicas**: This feature allows you to set minimum and maximum replicas based on resource consumption (CPU and memory threshold).\n  - **Min Replicas**: Set a minimum (recommended at least `2`).\n  - **Max Replicas**: Define a maximum limit for scaling.\n  - **CPU/Memory Thresholds**: Specify thresholds for resource utilization that trigger scaling actions.\n\n### Troubleshooting\nIf your application responds with a 503 status code on the first request after scaling up, consider adjusting the readiness probe settings in the **DevOps** > **Health Checks** view.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to the relevant documentation on Choreo:\n- [Enable Scale-to-Zero](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/#enable-scale-to-zero)\n- [Autoscale Component Replicas](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-component-replicas/)"

My build fails during trivy scan,"If a build fails during a Trivy scan in Choreo, you can follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue:\n\n1. **Identify the Vulnerability**: When the build fails, check the deployment pane for the Trivy scan status. It will display any security failures detected during the scan. Click on the relevant section to view details about the identified vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Address the Vulnerability**: \n   - The recommended approach is to fix the vulnerabilities identified by Trivy in your component. This might involve updating or replacing third-party libraries that have known security issues.\n   \n3. **Using `.trivyignore`**: If you want to bypass the failure temporarily, you can create a `.trivyignore` file. Ensure that this file is added to the Docker build context path when creating the component (e.g., `{buildContextPath}/trivyignore`). This will instruct Trivy to ignore specified vulnerabilities during the scan.\n\n4. **Rebuild the Component**: After addressing the vulnerabilities or adding the `.trivyignore` file, rebuild your component to see if the changes resolve the issue.\n\n5. **Redeploy the Component**: Once the build is successful, proceed to redeploy your component.\n\nThese steps should help in resolving issues related to build failures during a Trivy scan.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation links:\n- [Troubleshoot component build errors](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/references/troubleshoot-choreo/#troubleshoot-component-build-errors)\n- [Scan third-party libraries to identify security vulnerabilities](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/work-with-the-micro-integrator-runtime-in-choreo/#scan-third-party-libraries-to-identify-security-vulnerabilities)"
I get build errors during vulnerability scan stage,"To resolve build errors during the vulnerability scan stage in Choreo, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Vulnerabilities**: During the deployment process, Choreo uses the Aqua Trivy scanner to check for security vulnerabilities in your Docker images. If critical vulnerabilities are found, the deployment will be halted, and these issues will be reported in the build logs.\n\n2. **Fix Vulnerabilities**: The recommended approach is to address the identified vulnerabilities directly in your code or dependencies. This means updating libraries or making code changes that eliminate the security issues.\n\n3. **Using `.trivyignore` File**: If you need to proceed with deployment without fixing a critical vulnerability immediately, you can create a `.trivyignore` file. This file should be placed in the Docker build context path (e.g., `<docker-build-context-path>/.trivyignore`). Inside this file, list the CVEs you want to ignore, one per line. You can also add comments prefixed with `#`. For example:\n   ```\n   # Ignore specific CVEs\n   CVE-2023-xxxx\n   CVE-2023-yyyy\n   ```\n\n4. **Rebuild and Redeploy**: After addressing the vulnerabilities or adding the `.trivyignore` file, you can rebuild your component. Monitor the build logs to ensure that the vulnerability scan passes without critical issues.\n\n5. **Check Build Logs**: You can access the build logs to see detailed information about the scans and any errors that may have occurred during the build process.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively manage and resolve build errors related to vulnerability scans in Choreo.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Troubleshoot component build errors](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/references/troubleshoot-choreo/#troubleshoot-component-build-errors)\n- [Scan third-party libraries to identify security vulnerabilities](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/work-with-the-micro-integrator-runtime-in-choreo/#scan-third-party-libraries-to-identify-security-vulnerabilities)\n- [Deploy the containerized component](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/deploy-a-containerized-application/#deploy-the-containerized-component)"
I have secret keys as configs for my react web app. How to manage them securely? ,"To securely manage secret keys for configurations in a React web application using Choreo, you can follow these best practices and utilize features that Choreo provides:\n\n### Managing Configurations and Secrets\nChoreo allows you to manage and version your application's configurations and secrets in a secure manner as either **file mounts** or **environment variables**. \n\n1. **Secrets vs. Configurations**:\n   - **Secrets**: These are write-only and once created, their content cannot be retrieved through the Choreo Console. You can overwrite existing secrets at any time. This is the recommended approach for sensitive data like database passwords or API keys.\n   - **Configurations**: These can be read and updated via the Choreo Console, making them suitable for non-sensitive data.\n\n2. **Storage**:\n   - All configurations and secrets are stored in an encrypted secret vault managed by WSO2. If you are using a private data plane, they will be stored in your chosen cloud environment's key management service (like Azure Key Vault or AWS Secret Manager).\n\n### Best Practices for React Applications\nWhen dealing with a Single Page Application (SPA) like React, there are specific considerations:\n\n- **Baking-in Environment Variables**: Choreo does not support embedding sensitive secrets directly into the client-side code as anything mounted will be accessible to users. Therefore, avoid including sensitive secrets that are not browser-safe.\n\n- **Runtime Configuration**:\n   - Create a `config.js` file in the `public` directory of your React application containing non-sensitive runtime configuration variables, such as API endpoints or feature flags.\n   - Reference these variables in your React components using the `window.config` object.\n\n   Example of `config.js`:\n   ```javascript\n   window.config = {\n       apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',\n       featureFlags: {\n           enableNewFeature: true,\n           enableExperimentalFeature: false,\n       },\n   };\n   ```\n\n### Updating Configurations or Secrets\nTo update an existing configuration or secret within Choreo:\n\n1. In the Choreo Console, select the component you want to modify.\n2. Navigate to **DevOps** > **Configs & Secrets**.\n3. Click the edit icon next to the configuration or secret you wish to update.\n4. Make the necessary changes and click **Save**.\n\n### Summary\nFor managing secret keys securely in a React web application using Choreo, focus on using secrets for sensitive data, ensure runtime configurations are non-sensitive, and utilize Choreo's secure storage capabilities.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the relevant documentation:\n- [Manage Configurations and Secrets](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/)\n- [Build and Deploy a Single-Page Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-web-applications/build-and-deploy-a-single-page-web-application/#manage-runtime-configurations-for-web-applications)"
What steps can I take to protect my web app?,"To protect web applications in Choreo, consider implementing the following recommended security practices based on OWASP guidelines and Choreo's managed authentication features:\n\n### 1. Authentication and Authorization\n- **Managed Authentication**: Utilize Choreo's managed authentication to simplify the integration of authentication and authorization into your web application. This includes setting up sign-in and sign-out functionalities that adhere to OIDC/OAuth2.0 protocols.\n  \n- **Short-lived Tokens**: Use short-lived JWT access tokens, ideally with an expiry time of no more than 900 seconds. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access if a token is compromised. Implement refresh tokens to allow users to obtain new access tokens without re-authenticating.\n\n### 2. Secure Token Management\n- **Encryption and Storage**: Ensure strong encryption for tokens and use secure storage methods to protect them from unauthorized access or leaks.\n\n### 3. Input Validation and Rate Limiting\n- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs to prevent common attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). This includes setting constraints on data types and sizes.\n  \n- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of your APIs. This helps mitigate the risk of denial-of-service attacks.\n\n### 4. Use of HTTPS\n- **Always Use HTTPS**: Ensure that all communications between clients and servers are conducted over HTTPS to protect sensitive data from being intercepted during transmission.\n\n### 5. CORS Configuration\n- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Properly configure CORS headers to control which domains can access your APIs. This mitigates risks associated with unauthorized cross-origin requests.\n\n### 6. JWT Best Practices\n- **JWT Security**: Ensure that JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are signed and possibly encrypted. Follow best practices for JWT usage, such as avoiding insecure algorithms and ensuring proper validation of tokens.\n\n### 7. Secure Error Handling\n- **Define Error Responses**: Implement clear and secure error handling mechanisms, including defining schemas for all response types, especially error responses. This prevents leaking sensitive information through error messages.\n\n### 8. Session Management\n- **Session Expiry Handling**: Implement logic to handle session expiry gracefully. Automatically redirect users to re-login when their session has expired to maintain security.\n\n### 9. Avoid Storing Sensitive Data in URLs\n- **No Sensitive Data in URLs**: Ensure that sensitive information, such as tokens or personal data, is not included in the URLs to prevent exposure through logs or browser history.\n\nFor more detailed guidance on these practices and to explore how to set them up specifically in Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation links:\n\n- [OWASP Top 10](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/api-governance/default-rulesets/owasp_top_10_doc/)\n- [Secure Web Applications with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/)\n- [Revoke Access Tokens](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-application/#revoke-access-tokens)\n\nThese practices will help in securing your web applications effectively within the Choreo environment."
What methods can I use to protect an API in Choreo?,"In Choreo, there are several methods available for API protection and security, focusing primarily on authentication and authorization. Here are the key methods:\n\n1. **Using External Identity Providers (IdP)**:\n   - **Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**: Organizations can integrate Azure AD with Choreo for identity and access management. This involves setting up Azure AD to authenticate API invocations and assigning scopes to the API.\n   - **Asgardeo**: Similar to Azure AD, Asgardeo can be used as an external IdP to authenticate API invocations. It also allows the assignment of scopes to an API within Choreo.\n\n   For detailed steps on integrating with these IdPs, you can refer to the following documentation:\n   - [Secure API Access with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-azure-ad/)\n   - [Secure API Access with Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-asgardeo/)\n\n2. **Built-In Security Token Service**:\n   - Choreo provides a built-in security token service that simplifies security testing. This service allows developers to test APIs with permissions in non-critical environments, utilizing features that generate scopes based on roles and user groups. \n\n   For more information on testing secure API access using Choreo's built-in capabilities, check out the following documentation:\n   - [Test Secure API Access with Choreo Built-In Security Token Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/test-secure-api-access-with-choreo-built-in-security-token-service/)\n\n3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:\n   - RBAC is a flexible method for managing access to API resources by assigning specific roles to users or groups. This method helps control what authenticated users can do and can be implemented using Choreo along with Asgardeo.\n\n   To learn more about implementing RBAC in Choreo, refer to the following tutorial:\n   - [Secure an API with Role-Based Access Control](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/tutorials/secure-an-api-with-role-based-access-control/)\n\nThese methods help ensure that APIs are protected against unauthorized access and that users can only perform actions that they are permitted to do."

"I'm getting """"procfile not found"""" error for my python service. How do I resolve this?","To resolve the 'Procfile not found' error for a Python service in Choreo, you need to ensure that a `Procfile` is present in the root directory of your project. The `Procfile` is a configuration file that declares the commands run by your application's containers, and it is mandatory for Python projects.\n\nHere’s how you can create and structure your `Procfile`:\n\n1. **Create a `Procfile`**: In the root directory of your project, create a file named `Procfile` (without any file extension).\n\n2. **Define the web process**: Inside the `Procfile`, you need to specify your web process type. For example:\n   ```\n   web: python main.py\n   ```\n   or\n   ```\n   web: gunicorn --bind :8080 --workers 1 --threads 8 --timeout 0 main:app\n   ```\n   or\n   ```\n   web: flask run --host=0.0.0.0\n   ```\n\n3. **Check your project structure**: Make sure that the `Procfile` is located directly at the root level of your project and not in any subdirectories.\n\nAfter ensuring that the `Procfile` is correctly set up, you should no longer encounter the 'Procfile not found' error when deploying your Python service in Choreo.\n\nFor more detailed examples and guidance, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/deploy-an-application-with-buildpacks/#develop-a-component)."
I'm getting .choreo/endpoints.yaml not found error. How do I resolve this?,"To resolve the error '.choreo/endpoints.yaml not found', you need to ensure that the `endpoints.yaml` file is correctly created and located in the appropriate directory. Here are the steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Location of the File**: The `endpoints.yaml` file must be placed in the `.choreo` directory at the root of your project directory. The expected file path is:\n   ```bash\n   <build-context-path>/.choreo/endpoints.yaml\n   ```\n\n2. **Create the File**: If the `endpoints.yaml` file does not exist, you will need to create it. Here’s a sample structure for the `endpoints.yaml` file:\n   ```yaml\n   version: 0.1\n   endpoints:\n     - name: Your Service\n       port: 9090\n       type: REST\n       networkVisibility: Project\n       context: /your-service\n       schemaFilePath: your_service_openapi.yaml\n   ```\n\n3. **Commit to Repository**: After creating or updating the `endpoints.yaml` file, ensure that you commit it to your repository so that the configuration can be tracked and managed effectively.\n\n4. **Using Component Configuration**: If you are using a `component.yaml` file, be aware that it takes precedence over the `endpoints.yaml` file. If you have both files, ensure that they are not conflicting.\n\nIf you follow these steps and ensure that the `endpoints.yaml` file is correctly configured and located, the error should be resolved.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on managing component source configurations [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/manage-component-source-configurations/#overview-of-the-endpointsyaml-file)."
Tell me how I can configure a readiness probe?,"To configure a readiness probe in Choreo, follow these steps:\n\n1. In the **Component Listing** pane, select the component for which you want to configure the readiness probe.\n2. In the left navigation menu, click on **DevOps** and then select **Health Checks**.\n3. On the **Health Checks** page, click **+ Create**.\n4. After that, you need to configure the readiness probe based on your specific requirements. You can choose to configure:\n   - **HTTP GET request**: This sends an HTTP GET request to a specified port and path on the container. A successful response status code is in the range of 200-399. It is recommended to create a `/healthz` or `/health` endpoint for this purpose.\n   - **TCP connection probe**: This attempts to open a socket to the container on a specified port. If it fails to establish a connection, it is considered a failure.\n   - **Execute a command**: This executes a given script inside the container. A non-zero return from the command indicates a failure.\n\n5. Once you have configured the probe, click **Save**.\n\nIt's important to note that readiness probes are crucial for ensuring that your application does not receive traffic when it is not ready to handle requests. If you have only a single replica running and its readiness probe fails, the application will stop receiving traffic and may not recover unless the liveness probe fails and restarts the container.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation: [Configure liveness and readiness probes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#configure-liveness-and-readiness-probes)."
